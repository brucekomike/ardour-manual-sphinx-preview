A [mixer strip]{.dfn} in Ardour is a vertical view of the track, from a
mixing point of view. This view is convenient to deal with I/O, effects,
panning/muting, gain, etc... It has a general \"top to bottom\" flow.

The mixer strips breaks down into:

1.  Header
2.  Track name
3.  Input(s)
4.  Polarity *only for audio tracks*
5.  Processor box
6.  Panner
7.  Recording options
8.  Mute/Solo
9.  Gain & Meter
10. Control master
11. Fader automation/mix group/metering point
12. Output(s)
13. Comments

## Headers

At the top of the window, is the [group
tabs](@@the-track-and-bus-group-list) (here, *recm...*). This allows to
group tracks together for common controls.

Below are 3 buttons:

- The double arrow button allows to shrink/expand the width of the
  strip. []{.kbd .mod1n}[]{.kbd .mod3n}[Click]{.kbd .mouse} the button
  will shrink/expand all the tracks at once
- The color bar shows the color of the track in the editor
- The [X]{.kbd .menu} button toggles the visibility of the track OFF. To
  turn it back ON, one can either go to the [Tracks and Busses
  list](@@the-tracks-and-busses-list) in the Editor view and check the
  \"V\" column on the track\'s line or stay in the Mixer view and check
  the [Show]{.kbd .menu} column of this strip in the [Strips
  list](@@strips-list).

[Right]{.kbd .mouse} clicking on the color bar will bring up a context
menu, which is exactly the same as clicking on the Track name button.

## Track Name

Clicking the Track name button will bring up a menu:

  ------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Color...                                    Changes the strip/track color
  Comments...                                 Shows an editor to put comments about the track, see below the Comments button
  Inputs...                                   Shows the Routing grid for the inputs of the track
  Outputs...                                  Shows the Routing grid for the outputs of the track
  Save As Template...                         Allows to save the track without its media content (I/O, effects,...) for later reuse
  Rename...                                   Changes the name of the track (effective both in the Mixer and the Editor)
  [Active]{.kbd .option}                      Select the active status of the track. An inactive track won\'t output any sound
  [Strict I/O]{.kbd .option}                  While in [Strict I/O](@@trackbus-signal-flow) mode, a track *always* has as many output as it has inputs, regardless of the effects. When disabled, a stereo effect put on a mono track will result in a stereo output for the strip.
  Disk I/O                                    This submenu allows switching between recording pre-fader signal, post-fader signal, or with custom record and playback positions. Only available for tracks.
  Pin Connections...                          Shows the [Pin Configuration]{.kbd .menu} window that shows (and allows to modify) all the signal flows inside the track. Only available for tracks and busses with at least one processor in the mixer strip.
  Patch selector...                           Opens a dialog for selecting a patch provided by MIDNAM. Only available for MIDI tracks.
  Fan out to Busses...                        Creates one bus per each output of a virtual instrument and connects to created busses. Only available for MIDI tracks where a virtual instrument has more than two audio outputs.
  Fan out to Tracks...                        Creates one track per each output of a virtual instrument and connects to created tracks. Only available for MIDI tracks where a virtual instrument has more than two audio outputs.
  [Protect Against Denormals]{.kbd .option}   Uses a trick to get rid of *denormals*, which are very small numbers the CPU can have a hard time dealing with. To be used if the CPU consumption for plugins is noticeably higher than expected
  Duplicate...                                Copies the track to a new one, optionally with its playlist
  Remove                                      Deletes the track and its playlist
  ------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Inputs

The dropdown button shows the current input port(s), i.e. what\'s
plugged to the \"in\" of the track. By default, each audio track is
connected to the system inputs, ready for recording, as shown by the
number(s). Clicking the dropdown Inputs button will allow to change the
inputs, through a menu:

  ------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Disconnect         Disconnects everything, i.e. the track has no input
  In *n*             Those are the system inputs, e.g. to record from the soundcard. A mono track will have *In 1* and *In 2* separated, while a stereo track can have *In 1+2*
  *Track n output*   All the outputs of compatible tracks, e.g., a mono track can only receive a mono signal, a MIDI track can only receive MIDI signal, ...
  Add Audio Port     Adds an audio input to the track, i.e. a mono audio track becomes a stereo one
  Add MIDI Port      Adds a MIDI input to the track. Adding it to an audio track makes it a mixed Audio/MIDI track. This can be useful e.g. to feed some plugins with a MIDI signal to control the audio, like a vocoder
  Routing Grid       Shows the [[Routing Grid]{.kbd .menu} window](@@patchbay), which allows for more complex input configuration
  ------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [Routing Grid]{.kbd .menu} can also be shown by right clicking the
dropdown Inputs button. It allows to make the connections through a
matrix, and connect things that are not listed in the menu above, or
connect to multiple sources at once, reduce the number of inputs, etc...

On audio tracks, is a Trim knob, as on traditional consoles. It set the
base input level for the track, avoiding any clipping. Notice that it
trims both any input, but (when playing back), also the level of the
playlist as displayed in the Editor. It makes sense as while playing,
the input of the track is the playlist, on which the mixer strip acts.

On midi tracks, it is replaced by a MIDI Input button, that
allows/disallows MIDI input on the track.

## Polarity

On audio tracks only, the Polarity button(s), 1 per input, allow to
reverse the signal, i.e. a negative value will be positive and
vice-versa. This can help deal with phasing issues.

## Processor box {#audio-midi-processor-box}

The processor box is where the effects are added. By default, one effect
is always present: the Fader (see below). The effects can be added
*pre*-fader and appear in brown, or *post*-fader, where they will appear
in dark green. The signal flow is represented by lines, red for the MIDI
and green for the audio.

It is also where the [Sends](@@aux-sends) come from, whether external or
auxiliary.

To learn more about the processor box, see [The Processor
Box](@@processor-box).

## Panner

The [Panner]{.dfn} visually displays how the sound will be distributed
between the different outputs. They\'ll look and behave differently if
the track is mono, stereo, or has multiple channels.

Right clicking the Panner will show a menu:

  ------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [Bypass]{.kbd .option}   When checked, the panner is grayed, and the signal is not affected by it
  Reset                    Resets the panner to its default settings, e.g. for a mono signal, it is centered
  Edit...                  Shows a [Panner]{.kbd .menu} dialog, which allows for fine tuning of the panner
  ------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See [Panning](@@panning) to learn more about how to control the panner,
and what kind of panners are available inside Ardour.

## Recording options

The most noticeable button here is the Record Enable one, with a red
circle. When enabled, next time the Global record will be armed and
playback started, everything that comes from the input of the track will
be recorded. Right clicking a disabled record button allows to enable
[Rec-Safe]{.kbd .menu}, thus protecting the track against accidental
recording.

The buttons on the right, [In]{.kbd .menu} and [Disk]{.kbd .menu}, show
what the user is listening to by lighting up, between the *In*put and
the actual content of the playlist on *Disk*.

They also allow to override the automatic switching by pressing them to
lock one source or the other to be what the user is hearing.

## Mute/Solo

These buttons allow to Mute (or silence) the track, or Solo them,
shutting down the gain of the other tracks (totally by default, can be
set to partially in the options). See [Muting and
Soloing](@@muting-and-soloing) for more information.

Notice that by default, Solo overrides Mute, i.e. if a track is both
Soloed and Muted, it will play. That can be changed in the preferences.

The two led button above are related to solo:

- Solo Isolate, as the name suggests, isolates tracks or busses from the
  solo system. When tracks or busses are soloed the isolated ones will
  not mute.
- Solo Lock locks the solo into its current state (i.e. solo on or solo
  off). It will not allow the solo state to be changed until the lock is
  released.

## Gain & Meter

On the right of this part is a [Meter](@@metering-in-ardour), displaying
the level of the track\'s output after the fader. In can be set to
display the signal at any point, see below *Metering Point*. Right
clicking this meter shows a menu allowing to switch the meter type.

The big Gain slider on the left allows to change the gain of the track.
Its default OdB value is reminded with a white horizontal line, and its
precise value is shown in a text field above it, that doubles as a way
to type in a numeric value.

The text field above the meter shows the \"Peak\", i.e. the maximum
value that has been reached during playback. To avoid distortion, the
value should stay below OdB, and if it goes above this value, the text
field will turn red. Clicking on this field will reset the Peak value
(for a new measurement or a new part of the track).

Notice that if any gain automation has been set and the automation state
is set on \"Play\" (see below), then the Gain fader is driven by the
automation, and not by the user. The Gain fader will turn grey to show
it is inactive.

## VCAs

If at least one [VCA](@@control-masters-mixer-strips) exists, this
button will show up, allowing the user to link this track to any control
master.

Clicking the button lists all the available control masters, and a menu
option to [Unassign all]{.kbd .menu}. Notice that a track can be a slave
to as many VCAs as they are in the session, hence multiplying the number
of VCA buttons. The displayed number is the number of the VCA, not the
count of VCAs linked to the track. A track with no VCA assigned will
show a unique button with a \"[-vca-]{.kbd .menu}\" label instead of
this number.

## Fader automation/mix group/metering point

### Fader automation mode

This button allows to choose the mode used regarding automation:

  -------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Manual   *(default)* The playback won\'t use the fader automation data
  Play     Enables playback/use of fader automation data
  Write    While the transport is rolling, all fader changes will be recorded to the fader automation lane
  Touch    While the transport is rolling, touching the fader will initiate recording all fader changes until the fader is released. When the fader is not being touched, existing automation data will be played/used to control the gain level.
  -------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Mix group

This button displays the mix group information as does the tab in the
header (see above). It is convenient though, as it allows to quickly
switch the track from one group to another with a drop down menu, also
allowing to affect the track to a non-adjacent group (which the tab
won\'t easily allow).

### Metering Point

The metering displayed in the meter is by default is \'Post\', i.e. Post
fader. It can be changed with this button to Any point of the signal
flow:

  -------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In       The input of the track
  Pre      Pre-fader
  Post     Post-fader
  Out      The output of the track
  Custom   A *Meter* processor is added to the processor box and can be set anywhere (by dragging and dropping) to probe the signal flow at that point
  -------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Output(s)

This button is exactly the same as the *Input* button, but applies to
the *output* of the track.

## Comments

This buttons open up a little text editor, that can be used to add some
written notes to the track, as e.g. a particular setting. The button\'s
caption is replaced by the beginning of the text, so it can be used as a
\"sub\" name for the track.
