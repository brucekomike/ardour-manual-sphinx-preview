Although track/bus [groups](@@the-track-and-bus-group-list) offer a
certain kind of grouped-control over gain, solo, mute and more,
traditional mixing consoles have long had group master channels
(\"[VCA]{.abbr title="Voltage-Controlled Amplifier"}s\") which allows to
combine both a single fader to control the group level while also
allowing to easily adjust the relative levels inside the group. For
large projects, this can make mixing much easier to control.

Ardour implements those [VCAs]{.dfn} in a way that allows to use either
or both of the conventions used on different traditional consoles for
combining multiple masters:

- Nest VCAs (VCA 2 controls VCA 1 etc.)
- Chain VCAs (VCA 1 and VCA 2 both control track or bus *N*)

## Description of the VCAs

A VCA strip is made of (from top to bottom in the screenshot):

1.  Number of the VCA
2.  [X]{.kbd .menu} button: Allows to hide the VCA strip. Left clicking
    this button toggles the exclusive visibility of the tracks connected
    to this VCA
3.  Name button
4.  [M]{.kbd .menu}: mutes the VCA, [S]{.kbd .menu}: solos the VCA
5.  Level meter: allows to adjust the level of the VCA
6.  [\~vca\~]{.kbd .menu}: a VCA button to optionally connect to another
    VCA

Right-clicking the name button shows a context menus comprised of:

  ----------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Rename            Renames the VCA
  Color...          Changes the color of the VCA button in the tracks connected to this one
  Drop All Slaves   Deletes all connections to this VCA, i.e. no tracks are controlled by this VCA anymore
  Remove            Deletes this VCA

## Connecting to a VCA strip

Connecting a track/bus/VCA to a VCA is as simple as clicking the VCA
button that appears on any mixer strip under the main fader and choosing
the VCA to connect to.

The VCA button only shows up in mixer strips when at least one VCA
exists, i.e., a VCA must be created *before* connecting tracks to it.

Clicking the VCA button shows all the VCAs in the session, and any or
all of this VCA can be checked to link them to the track, making this
track controlled by multiple VCAs. The track will then show multiple
buttons. Disconnecting a VCA from a track is done by unchecking this VCA
in the list that pops up, or clicking [Unassign All]{.kbd .menu} to
disconnect from all VCAs at once.
