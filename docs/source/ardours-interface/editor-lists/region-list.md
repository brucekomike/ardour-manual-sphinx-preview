# The Regions List
The Regions list shows all the regions in the session, with infos about
them in a tabular form. Any column caption can be clicked to sort the
list according to the clicked value:

  -------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Name     The name of the region, can be modified by double-clicking it
  \# Ch    Number of channels for an audio region (0 for MIDI)
  Tags     User-added tag text, can be modified by double clicking it
  Start    position of the start of the region on the global timeline
  Length   duration of the region
  -------- ---------------------------------------------------------------

The time format used for *Start* and *Length* follows the [Primary
Clock](@@editing-clocks) one.

At the right of the list are three columns of flags that can be altered:

  ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  □ L   whether the region position is locked, so that it cannot be moved.
  □ M   whether the region is muted, so that it will not be heard.
  □ O   whether the region is opaque; opaque regions 'block' regions below them from being heard, whereas 'transparent' regions have their contents mixed with whatever is underneath.
  ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hovering the mouse pointer over a column heading shows a tool-tip which
can be handy to remember what the columns are for.

A handy feature of the region list is that its regions can be dragged
and dropped into a suitable track in the session.
