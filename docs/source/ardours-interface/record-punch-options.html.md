## Punch controls {#punch_controls}

![The punch controls](/images/punch-controls.png)

The punch controls available in the main toolbar, work in conjunction
with the punch clocks, only visible while in Editor Mode.

The [In]{.kbd .menu} and [Out]{.kbd .menu} buttons relate to the Punch
range, and allow to use only one of the two punch boundaries, or both:

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  In only        Records from the In marker on, without an end boundary
  Out only       Records until the Out marker, without a beginning boundary
  In *and* Out   Records only between the In and Out markers
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

## Recording mode {#rec-mode}

The recording mode affects how the tracks behave when overdubbing:

  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Layered       New regions will be layered on top of existing ones. Only the top layer will be played. This is the recommended mode for most workflows.
  Non-Layered   The existing regions are trimmed so that there are no overlaps. This does not affect the previously recorded audio data, and trimmed regions can be expanded again at will. Non-layered mode can be very useful for spoken word material, especially in combination with [push/pull trimming](@@pushpull-trimming).
  Snd on Snd    New regions will be layered on top of existing ones and made transparent. This means all overlapping layers will be played at the same time. This mode is typically recommended for progressively building up MIDI tracks, e.g. a drum track, in each individual take.
