# Status Bar
![The Status Bar](/images/status-bar.png)

The status bar is an informative bar at the top of the window. Right
clicking anywhere on the Status Bar allows to choose which of this
information is displayed, through a checkbox menu, among:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| Path to Session: | the folder where the session files are |
| Snapshot Name and Modified Indicator: | the name of the snapshot being worked on. If the session has been modified since last save, the name is prefixed with an asterisk (\*). |
| Active Peak-file work: | *(only shows up while creating peaks)* displays the number of peak files left to create |
| File Format: | the file format used in the session, including when recording |
| Timecode Format: | is the timecode, i.e. the number of frames per second used by the session (for videos) |
| Audio: | gives the sample rate used in the session, and the latency computed from the buffer size |
| Disk Space: | reports the remaining hard disk space as the time that can be recorded with the current session setting |
| DSP: | for *D*igital *S*ound *P*rocessing, shows worst case system load used by Ardour and plugins for realtime processing. The value is the percentage of *time required to process* vs. *time available to process*. |
| Wall Clock | showing the system time (especially useful in full screen mode) |
| Log button | that indicates if Ardour has encountered any warning or error. |

Some of these indicators also double as a shortcut to a relevant action,
triggered by double clicking the info field:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| Path to Session / Snapshot Name and Modified Indicator | opens the session path in the file explorer |
| File Format: | opens the *Media* section of the [Session Properties](@@session-properties#properties-media) |
| Timecode Format: | opens the *Timecode* section of the [Session Properties](@@session-properties#properties-timecode) |
| Audio: | opens the [Audio MIDI Setup](@@audio-midi-setup) window. |
| Log button | The log button turns yellow when a warning is shown, and red when an error occurs. Clicking the log button gives access to the log. |
