## Snap {#grid_controls-snap}

[Snap]{.dfn} will cause region drags and other mouse-driven operations
to jump to positions determined by the nearest snap setting when the
mouse is close enough to this snap point. Snapping is sometimes
(improperly) referred to as magnetism.

The Snap options are set in the
[Preferences](@@preferences#preferences-editor-snap). Those include the
Snap Threshold which determines how close the mouse has to be to a snap
anchor to induce a snap, and the snap anchors themselves, among:

- Markers
- Region Sync points
- Region Starts
- Region Ends
- Grid.

## Grid {#grid_controls-grid}

The *Grid* helps visually placing items in time. It will draw lines at
selected intervals as chosen in the drop-down selector. Musical grid
settings (*Bar* to *Sextuplets*) obviously depend on the [tempo and time
signature](@@tempo-and-meter), so changing the tempo or time signature
will rescale the grid, while absolute grid settings (*Timecode*, etc...)
won\'t be affected.

A word about time signature in this context: a time signature consists
of 2 numbers. The upper one determines how many beats are in a bar, the
lower one, what division of a note a beat represents (e.g. : *4* stands
for a quarter note). At e.g. 80 [bpm]{.abbr title="beats per minute"},
one beat lasts 1/80th min, so 0.75 sec. If the time signature is 3/4,
there are 3 beats in a bar so a bar lasts for 3 × 0.75 = 2.25 sec.
Choosing *1/8 Note* as the grid setting will draw grid lines every 0.75
÷ 1/4 × 1/8 = 0.375 sec.

The grid density can be either based on musical time:

- *No Grid*: hides the Grid
- *Bar*: shows one grid line per bar (e.g, in 4/4 at 120bpm, one line
  every 2 seconds)
- *1/4*: shows one grid line per quarter bar, or 4 grid lines per bar
  (e.g, in 4/4 at 120bpm, one line every .5 seconds)
- *\...*
- *1/128*: shows one grid line per 128^th^ bar, or 128 grid lines per
  bar
- *Triplets*: groups the ternary divisions of time:
  - *1/3 (8th triplet)*: shows one grid line per third bar
  - *\...*
  - *1/24 (64th triplet)*: shows one grid line per 24^th^ bar
- *Quintuplets*: groups the 1/5^th^ divisions of time:
  - *1/5 (8th quintuplet)*: shows one grid line per fifth bar
  - *\...*
  - *1/20 (32th quintuplet)*: shows one grid line per 20^th^ bar
- *Septuplets*: groups the 1/7^th^ divisions of time:
  - *1/7 (8th septuplet)*: shows one grid line per seventh bar
  - *\...*
  - *1/28 (32th septuplet)*: shows one grid line per 28^th^ bar

Or absolute time:

- *Timecode*: shows one grid every [frame](@@on-clock-and-time)
- *MinSec*: shows one grid line every thousandth of a second
- *CD Frames*: shows one grid line per CD Frame (1/75^th^ second)

Alternatively, Ardour can disable the usual musical/non-musical time
grid and make the current playhead position the only snappable target.
To do that, select the \"Playhead\" item in the drop-down list.

The grid consist of lines running vertically in the edit canvas. When
zooming too far out, the grid can become too coarse. Ardour tries not to
show "too many" or "too few" grid lines depending on the zoom level,
based on the *Approximate Grid/Ruler granularity (pixels)*
[Preferences](@@preferences#preferences-editor-snap) parameter. As a
consequence, when the Grid is in the Snap anchors, it is possible that
items snap in-between the grid lines sometimes. That's expected
behavior.

Syncing Regions to the Grid

By default, a region\'s beginning will be used as the reference for both
types of snapping, this behaviour can be changed by setting a [sync
point]{.dfn} in the region, by selecting the region(s) and pressing
[V]{.kbd}. This will set the sync point to the current [edit
point](@@edit-point-control).

### Keyboard modifiers

Snapping can be temporarily disabled by using a keyboard modifier while
editing, []{.kbd .mod2n} by default.

Snapping can also be temporarily set to relative, i.e. snapping will
occur relative to the current position of the dragged item. E.g. if the
Grid is in the Snap options, and the grid is set to *Bars*, using this
keyboard modifier while dragging will snap at every bar relative to the
region\'s beginning (or sync point) instead of the absolute musical
bars.

The keyboard modifiers are defined in the
[Preferences](@@preferences#preferences-editor-modifiers).
