The [Master strip]{.dfn} in Ardour is very similar to the other [busses
mixer strips](@@audiomidi-busses-mixer-strips). There are nevertheless a
few differences due to the nature of the Master strip, that is being the
last point of treatment before the output or rendering:

- There is no color affected to the master strip
- There is exactly one and only one Master Bus Strip for a session, so
  it cannot be saved as a template, duplicated or removed in the context
  menu, although it can be renamed.
- The master strip cannot be hidden or disabled, so there is not
  [X]{.kbd} in the top right, nor an [Active]{.kbd .option} checkbox in
  the context menu.
- It is by definition always solo, so there is no [Solo]{.kbd} button,
  and [Iso]{.kbd} and [Lock]{.kbd} are disabled.
- If the [Master bus output gain control](@@loudness-analyzer) is
  enabled, two controls are visible:
  - a [LAN]{.kbd} button, to start the Loudness Analyzer & Normalizer,
  - a volume slider to that can be controlled manually or set by the
    Normalizer.
- If the session has a [Monitoring
  section](@@session-properties#properties-monitoring), two buttons are
  visible:
  - [Mute]{.kbd} to mute the Master bus while the monitoring is still
    active,
  - [Mon]{.kbd} to show/hide the monitoring section in the Mixer view.
- It cannot belong to a mix group, so the [Grp]{.kbd} button is missing.

The Master bus strip is *always* fixed, at the right end of the mixer,
regardless of the scrolling position.
