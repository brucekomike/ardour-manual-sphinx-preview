# Rulers
![Ardour\'s Ruler](/images/ruler.png){style="width:100%;"}

The [ruler]{.dfn} scales the session along time, allows navigating, and
can be marked for different uses.

One of its main uses is to move the playhead: clicking anywhere on the
timeline will bring the playhead at this location in time. Also, using
the mouse\'s scrollwheel while hovering the ruler will zoom in or out
([⇑]{.kbd .mouse}/[⇓]{.kbd .mouse} ).

The ruler is made of a succession of rows, each having a special role
related to time. Adding or removing rows can be done by [right]{.kbd
.mouse} clicking anywhere in the ruler\'s header on the left, and
ticking any of:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| [Mins:Secs]{.dfn} | scaling the session with the Mins:Secs:mSec notation |
| [Timecode]{.dfn} | scaling the session with the Hours:Mins:Secs:Frames notation |
| [Samples]{.dfn} | scaling the session with the sample number notation |
| [Bars:Beats]{.dfn} | slicing the time according to the time signature |
| [Time Signature]{.dfn} | shows the time signature. It can be changed along the timeline, by [Right-click]{.kbd .mouse} \> [New Time Signature]{.kbd .menu}. The Bars:Beats ruler will reflect the change. |
| [Tempo]{.dfn} | shows the BPM. It can be changed along the timeline, by [Right-click]{.kbd .mouse} \> [New Tempo]{.kbd .menu}. The Bars:Beats ruler will reflect the change. |
| [Range Markers]{.dfn} | allow to create and modify ranges directly on the Ruler. |
| [Location Markers]{.dfn} | is meant to receive any kind of marker, user generated or from Ardour itself. |
| [Arrangement]{.dfn} | allows creating range sections like a verse, a chorus, a bridge etc. |
| [Video Timeline]{.dfn} | shows thumbnails of the [video](@@video-timeline-and-monitoring) in the timeline |

Most rulers allow placing markers to serve a specific purpose: mark a
point in time, define a loop range, or something else entirely.

Most of the operations on the markers are described in [Working with
Markers](@@working-with-markers), additional information on Time
Signature, Tempo, Bars:Beats, and Timecode is available in the [Tempo
and Time Signature](@@tempo-and-meter) chapter.
