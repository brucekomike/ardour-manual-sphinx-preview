# Transport Bar
## The transport controls

The [Transport Bar]{.dfn} groups all the actions regarding the control
of playback and recording.

### Transport action buttons {#transport_action_buttons}

The upper row contains transport actions, that are all bound to keyboard
shortcuts, which allows for speedier use and more focused work:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| Midi Panic | Immediately stops all midi output. |
| Enable/disable Audio Click | Toggles (on/off) a click track (metronome) along the [tempo](@@tempo-and-meter). Right clicking brings up the [Click]{.kbd .menu} submenu from the Preferences. Scrolling with the mouse wheel adjusts the gain of the click. |
| Go to Start of the Session | Jumps back at the beginning of the session, as defined by the [start marker](@@working-with-markers). |
| Go to End of the Session | Jumps forward to the end of the session, as defined by the [end marker](@@working-with-markers). |
| Play Loop Range | Repeats the defined [loop](@@controlling-playback) as defined by the [Loop range](@@the-loop-range), until the \"Stop playback\" button is pressed. Clicking the \"Play loop Range\" button while already active switches to normal Play mode, which exits the loop without stopping and restarting playback. |
| Play Range/Selection | If a range has been defined using the Range Mode button, plays the range, of if an audio or MIDI region is selected, plays this region. In both cases, the playback stops at the end of the range or selected region. |
| Play from playhead | Starts the playback and optionally record (more below). |
| Stop | Whatever the playing mode (loop, range, ...) stops all playback. Depending on other settings, some effects (like chorus or reverb) might still be audible for a while. |
| Toggle Record | Global switch button to activate/deactivate recording. While active, the button blinks red. The button doesn\'t start recording by itself: if one or more tracks are marked as record-enabled, pressing the \"Play from Playhead\" starts recording on those tracks. |

If Ardour is synchronized with other devices then some or all of these
control methods may be unavailable---depending on the synchronization
protocol, Ardour may respond only to commands sent from its master
device(s).

### The Transport modifiers {#transport_modifiers}

#### The Shuttle Speed Control {#transport_shuttle}

Under these buttons is the [Shuttle Speed Control]{.dfn} that allows to
*temporarily* scrub through the audio quickly. The slider decides the
playback speed: the further from the center it is set, the faster the
playback will scrub in both directions. The range of this acceleration
can be set by [right]{.kbd .mouse}-clicking the control and setting the
multiplier, either 1.5 (± 150%) or 2 (± 200%).

#### VariSpeed {#transport_varispeed}

The [VS]{.kbd .menu} (for *V*ari*S*peed) button sets a *constant*
playback/record speed. It can be set in semitones (1 semitone = × 2
^1⁄12^ ≈ 105,9%), cents of semitones, or percentages, and is
armed/disarmed by clicking the button. The [VS]{.kbd .menu} button will
blink when VariSpeed is enabled. Whether or not this VariSpeed is
persistent when stopping/restarting transport depends on the [Reset
default speed on stop]{.kbd .option} parameter in the
[Preferences](@@preferences#preferences-transport) dialog.

#### Transport Sync {#transport_sync}

On the left of the slider is the positional sync button (which might
show [Internal]{.dfn}, or [MTC]{.dfn} or several other values), than can
be used to control whether or not the transport position and start is
controlled by Ardour, or by an external positional synchronization
source, such as MIDI Time Code (MTC), Linear Time Code (LTC) or JACK
(see [Timecode Generators and
Slaves](@@timecode-generators-and-slaves)).

#### Transport Status {#transport_status}

The current playback status (Stop, Play, or speed %) is shown on the
right of the speed slider.

## Using Key Bindings

Ardour has many available commands for playback control that can be
bound to keys. Many of them have default bindings, some do not, so the
list below shows both the default bindings and internal command names
for some of them.

|               |                                        |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| [Space]{.kbd} | Switch between playback and stop.      |
| [Home]{.kbd}  | Move playhead to session start marker  |
| [End]{.kbd}   | Move playhead to session end marker    |
| [→]{.kbd}     | Playhead to next region boundary       |
| [←]{.kbd}     | Playhead to previous region boundary   |
| [0]{.kbd}     | Move playhead to start of the timeline |

The [Transport]{.kbd .menu} and [Transport \> Playhead]{.kbd .menu}
menus contain a lot more transport actions and their key bindings.
