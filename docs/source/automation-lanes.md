# Automation Lanes
An [automation lane]{.dfn} is similar to a track in that it holds data
that can be played back. However, unlike a track, it is not an
independent entity---it is always attached to the track that it
controls. Automation lanes also contain zero to one [automation
curves]{.dfn}. Each lane controls one and only one parameter of the
track it is attached to.

Every track will have at least five automation lanes associated with it:
trim, fader, mute, and pan (which consists of two lanes: L/R and Width);
it can possibly have many more if there are any processors associated
with it. All these lanes are automatically attached to the track but
hidden, and initially they are all empty (have no automation curves in
them).

Automation lanes typically have the following controls:

- A hide button (square button with an \"X\" inside)
- A horizontal fader
- An [automation mode]{.dfn} selector

The hide button, as the name implies, hides the automation lane. The
horizontal fader controls the level of the parameter that the lane
controls; manipulating this while in [Write]{.kbd .menu} or [Touch]{.kbd
.menu} mode during playback will make changes to the lane\'s automation
curve. The automation mode selector selects which mode the lane is in
([Manual]{.kbd .menu}, [Play]{.kbd .menu}, [Write]{.kbd .menu}, or
[Touch]{.kbd .menu}).

The hide button will only hide the lane; it does not remove it from the
track. The automation lane never really goes away---the closest one can
get to that is to clear the automation curve and hide the lane.
