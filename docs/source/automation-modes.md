# Automation Modes
Ardour offers two modes for interpolating automation control points:
[Linear]{.kbd .menu} and [Discrete]{.kbd .menu}. The mode is changed by
a [Right]{.kbd .mouse} click on the automation lane header and choosing
the mode from the mode menu.

[Linear]{.kbd .menu} mode interpolates values between control points in
a given automation curve by connecting them with straight lines; the
values played back are derived from the points that lie on the lines
thus defined. Typically, this is what is desired and is the default mode
for all automation lanes.

[Discrete]{.kbd .menu} mode does *no* interpolation between control
points in a given automation curve. The values set by the control points
do not change until the following control point is reached at which time
the value is then set to its value; this continues on until there are no
more control points. Typically this is used for parameters such as mute
or sustain pedal (e.g., on a MIDI piano track).

When recording automation via MIDI (e.g., pitch bend from a MIDI
keyboard), Ardour always uses discrete mode.
