# Bundle Manager
The [Bundle Manager]{.dfn} simplifies connecting I/O channels in cases
where similarly purposed instruments/mics are scattered across a
multi-channel audio interface. A common scenario is recording a drumkit
with 6 mics. If you need to re-route the mics in the session, instead of
connecting each and every one of them separately, you can create a
bundle and connect just the bundle.

Bundles can be created for both sources (e.g. mic inputs) and
destinations (e.g. studio monitors). You can create as many bundles as
you like.

## Creating a bundle

Click [New]{.kbd .menu} button to create a new bundle. In the newly
opened dialog, give it a name, choose whether you want this to be a
bundle of source or destination channels, then connect the ports that
you want to collect to the bundle port.

Close the dialog to apply changes.

## Connecting a bundle

When connecting a bundle to a port, it works as a convenience proxy for
the physical ports. Clicking to connect a bundle (here, \"Guitar tracks
in\") to an input automatically connects all the actuel ports in the
bundle at once.

## Editing and deleting bundles

At any time you can re-open the Bundle Manager window, select a bundle,
click [Edit]{.kbd .menu} and change connection of physical ports to the
bundle. Close the window to apply changes.

You can easily delete an existing bundle. Open the Bundle Manager
window, select a bundle, click [Delete]{.kbd .menu}.

## Reusing bundles

As bundles are part of a session rather than a global setting, you can
save them as part of a template for further reuse. Simply create a new
session, create and connect tracks, busses, and bundles, then save your
session as a template. Choose this template when creating a new session.
