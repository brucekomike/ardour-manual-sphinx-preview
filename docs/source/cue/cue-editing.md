# Editing Cues
You can edit pre-loaded or recorded clips in trigger slots directly on
the Cue page. Simply click on a clip to open clip properties and the
editor in the bottom pane.

The editor interface is largely the same as in the [region
editor](@@region-editor) on the Editor page and the separate [pianoroll
window](@@pianoroll-window).

The main areas are:

- Editor toolbar, with view options, editing mode selection, and other
  controls.
- Zoom control on the left that sets how many octaves you see at once
  and which ones.
- The main pianoroll area that displays notes.
- The automation editing area below.

## Editing notes

There are two available editing modes: Draw and Edit.

With the Draw mode, you can:

- Add new notes with predefined length by setting the length in the
  editor toolbar and single-clicking on the timeline.
- Draw notes with custom length by clicking on the timeline and dragging
  to the right.
- Brush notes by pressing [Shift]{.kbd}, clicking, and dragging to the
  right. New notes will be painted at an interval defined by global
  quantization, with the length defined in the editor toolbar.

See this [chapter](@@add-new-notes#add-new-notes-using-the-mouse) for
details on adding MIDI notes.

With the Edit mode, you can:

- Select multiple notes:
  - with [Ctrl]{.kbd} for any separate notes you click;
  - with [Shift]{.kbd} for all notes between the currently selected note
    and the clicked-on note;
  - with rubberband selection cue by clicking on an empty area and
    dragging towards notes.
- Move notes by selecting them, then clicking on their middle parts and
  dragging up/down or left/right.
- Trim and extend notes by pointing at their left/right sides, clicking,
  and dragging the edges.
- Split and join notes using [S]{.kbd} and [J]{.kbd} shortcuts. [See
  this chapter](@@note-splitting-joining) for more information.

## Editing automation

You can create new automation in the Draw mode and edit existing
automation in the Edit mode. Please refer to [this
chapter](@@track-automation) for details on editing workflows and
methods.

The automation editing area displays note velocity and controllers and
is disabled by default. Clicking on any of the available controller
options (Velocity, Bender, Pressure, Modulation) enables it.

To enable or disable an automation lane, click on the small LED
indicator to the left of its name on the bottom toolbar.

The area can display data from multiple controllers, overlaid on top of
each other, but only one automation lane is editable at the time.
