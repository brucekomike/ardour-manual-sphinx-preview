# Recording cues
You can record audio and MIDI from respective inputs into trigger slots
to play them back. Here is the workflow.

1.  On the Cue page, Click on the record button at the top of the track
    you want to record to. The play buttons for every slot turns into a
    record enable button.
2.  Select a trigger slot
3.  Click the recording button to the left of the selected trigger slot
    to enable recording
4.  Start the transport (typically by clicking the Play button in the
    transport toolbar or pressing [Space]{.kbd})

By default, the recording will be 1 bar long; you can change this in the
clip properties area, using the length dropdown selector above the
pianoroll:

If you select \"Until Stopped\", then recording will continue until you
explicitly stop the recording, most typically by pressing the space bar
on your computer.

Ardour will count down (the number of beats depends on launch
quantization and position of the playhead) and start recording.

As soon as the playhead reaches the end of the defined recording length,
Ardour will stop recording and start playing back the clip you\'ve just
recorded.

Note that if you use the rec-enable button just to the left of the
recording length selector, it will also enable the track for cue
recording if it is not already enabled.
