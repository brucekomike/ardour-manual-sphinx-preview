# Bouncing Regions
Selected region or multiple selected regions from any tracks can be
exported to dedicated files. This creates audio files on the disk inside
project\'s \'interchange\' folder and automatically adds them to the
Sources list.

There are two commands to do so: [Bouncing without processing]{.kbd
.menu} and [Bouncing with processing]{.kbd .menu}, both available in the
top-level [Region]{.kbd .menu} menu, as well as in the context
(right-click) menu of regions.

## Bouncing without processing

This method disables all processing in the mixer channel, including
fader/panner and pre- and post-fader processors. It will however apply
non-destructive gain adjustment and fade in/out envelopes to audio
clips.

Dropping all processing in the mixer channel effectively means that in
the case of MIDI regions, MIDI files will be exported to the disk.

The dialog with bouncing settings will provide different options based
on several possible scenarios.

### One track, one region

If just one region is selected, Ardour will automatically suggest using
the region name as is. It will also provide two options:

- Automatically loading the exported file into a respective slot of a
  cue of user\'s choice.
- Bouncing the region to a user-defined Clips folder so that it could be
  reused across sessions.

### Multiple tracks, one region per each track

When the selection contains multiple regions, and each region is on a
separate track, this makes it possible to automatically add exported
files to respective slots in a cue. However since multiple regions are
selected, Ardour will use original region names and prepend them with
user-given text, if the user chooses to submit any. E.g. adding
\"take1-\" prefix to \"piano\" and \"bass\" regions of respective mono
tracks will create \"take1-piano.wav\" and \"take1-bass.wav\" files.

### One or more tracks, two and more regions per track

When the selection contains at least two regions in the same track, the
option to add bounced files to cue slots is not available, as two and
more clips cannot be loaded into the same slot. Ardour will also ask for
an optional prefix and provide an option to bounce to the Clips folder.

## Bouncing with processing

This method applies all processing in the mixer channel. If the original
data is MIDI and it passes a virtual instrument that translates it into
audio, an audio file will be exported. Since this changes the nature of
the data, bouncing to trigger slots is unavailable as MIDI tracks cannot
contain audio data.

Just like in the case of bouncing without processing, availability of
options depends on the use case.

### One track, one region

In this scenario, Ardour will automatically suggest using region\'s name
and provide an option to bounce to the Clips folder.

### Any amount of tracks and regions per track

In this scenario, Ardour will use an optional user-defined prefix to
prepend original region names with it when creating audio files. There
also is an option to bounce to the Clips folder.
