# Export Dialog
When the work in Ardour is finished, one or multiple sound file(s) need
to be created, be it to be printed to a medium such as a CD or DVD,
uploaded to a streaming site or sent to another person or software for
further work. This can be done either using [Session \> Export \> Export
to Audio file(s)...]{.kbd .menu}.

## File Format {#export-file_format}

This tab contains controls for the format of the exported audio file(s).
More than one format can be enabled here, in which case each will be
exported in turn. Ardour is supplied with a list of export formats,
including:

- Amazon Music
- Apple Music
- BWAV 24bit
- BWAV 32float
- CD (Red Book)
- FLAC 24 bit
- MP3 (extreme)
- MP3 (medium)
- MP3 (standard)
- Ogg/Vorbis
- Ring Tone
- Soundcloud and Spotify
- Wav (Tagged)
- YouTube and Deezer

These formats can be edited, or new ones created, with the [\"Edit
Export Format Profile\"](@@export-format-profiles) dialog, which appears
when clicking the [Edit]{.kbd .menu} or [New]{.kbd .menu} buttons to the
right of the drop-down list of formats.

Presets can also be created, consisting of one or more formats. Ardour
provides some ready-made presets, too:

- CD + Ogg/Vorbis + FLAC
- CD only
- DVD-A only
- FLAC
- Ogg/Vorbis
- Ogg/Vorbis + FLAC
- Streaming

## The location {#export-location}

Aside from providing a way to tell Ardour *where* to put the created
file(s), the [location]{.dfn} part of the window allows to name the
exported files with a lot of choice regarding the naming convention,
hence blending into the user\'s workflow, and providing a clean way to
keep the export folders from being cluttered with poorly named files.

The name of the file(s) can optionally be made of:

- The session or snapshot\'s name
- A custom label (i.e., any text)
- A revision number
- The name of the timespan (see below)
- A date (in multiple formats)
- A time (also in multiple format).

As in the screenshot above, when writing a file could erase a present
file with the same name, Ardour shows a yellow warning line in the
bottom of the window, and a button to list all the files that would be
erased and replaced.

## Overwriting Files {#export-overwrite}

Ardour checks whether exporting will overwriting existing files. If such
files are discovered, it will display a warning in the lower right
corner of the window. Clicking the [List files]{.kbd} button next to the
message will display the list of file that will be overwritten.

## Analyze exported audio {#export-analyze}

![The Export Report/Analysis
window](/images/export-report-analysis.png){.hdimage width="50%"}

Checking [Analyze Exported Audio]{.kbd .option} shows the Export
Report/Analysis window. This provides a lot of useful information about
the exported file:

- the file name and location
- its format
- its channel count
- its sample rate
- its duration and timecode.

It also allows to [Play]{.kbd .menu} the file, and the [ Open
Folder]{.kbd .menu} button gives a quick access to the place where it
has been created.

The most prominent feature though, are the two generated views of the
audio file in time (waveform) and frequency (sonograph) domain, and the
loudness analysis, giving:

- the Peak value
- the True Peak value (to take inter sample peaks into account)
- the Normalization Gain (if it has been applied)
- the Integrated Loudness
- the loudness range
- a graph of the multiplicity of the peaks at the different loudness
  levels.

## Time Span {#export-timespan}

![The Time Span tab](/images/export-dialog-timespan.png){.hdimage}

This tab allows to select the range (or ranges) of the timeline to
export. By default, \"session\" is enabled---this will export the whole
session from the start marker to the end marker. Any loop or range
present in the session can be chosen, or a combination thereof.

The realtime checkboxes allow to export audio as it is played, and not
freewheeling to render the file as fast as Ardour can. This can prevent
odd behaviours from some plugins (reverbs, etc\...). This can be chosen
globally (with the [Realtime Export]{.kbd .option} checkbox at the top)
or individually on a per time span basis, with the [RT]{.kbd .option}
checkbox next to each time span.

## Channels {#export-channels}

![The Channels tab](/images/export-dialog-channels.png){.hdimage}

This tab decides which outputs (tracks or busses) should be sent to the
exported file. By default, only the Master Bus is sent.
