# Using the Mouse
## Clicking

Throughout this manual, the term [click]{.dfn} refers to the act of
pressing and releasing the [Left]{.kbd .mouse} mouse button. This action
is used to select objects, activate buttons, turn choices on and off,
pop up menus and so forth. On touch surfaces, it also corresponds to a
single, one-finger tap on the GUI.

## Right-Clicking

The term [right-click]{.dfn} refers to the act of pressing and releasing
the [Right]{.kbd .mouse} mouse button. This action is used to pop up
[context menus]{.dfn} (hence the term \"context click\", which will also
be seen). It is also used by default in combination with the shift key
to delete objects within the editor window.

Some mice designed for use with Mac OS X may have only one button. By
convention, pressing and holding the Control key while clicking is
interpreted as a right-click by many applications.

## Middle-Clicking

A [middle-click]{.dfn} refers to the act of pressing and releasing the
[Middle]{.kbd .mouse} mouse button. Not all mice have a middle click
button (see the [Mouse](@@mouse) chapter for details). Sometimes the
scroll wheel acts as a clickable middle button. This action is used for
time-constrained region copying and mapping MIDI bindings.

Internally, your operating system may identify the mouse buttons as
[Button1]{.kbd .mouse}, [Button2]{.kbd .mouse}, and [Button3]{.kbd
.mouse}, respectively. It may be possible to invert the order of buttons
to accommodate left-handed users, or to re-assign them arbitrarily. This
manual assumes the canonical order.

## Double-Clicking

A [double click]{.dfn} refers to two rapid press/release cycles on the
leftmost mouse button. The time interval between the two actions that
determines whether this is seen as two clicks or one double click is
controlled by your system preferences, not by Ardour.

## Dragging

A [drag]{.dfn} primarily refers to the act of pressing the leftmost
mouse button, moving the mouse with the button held down, and then
releasing the button. On touch surfaces, this term also corresponds to a
single one-finger touch-move-release action.

Ardour also uses the middle mouse button for certain kinds of drags,
which will be referred to as a [middle-drag]{.dfn}.

## Modifiers

There are many actions in Ardour that can be carried out using a mouse
button in combination with a [modifier key]{.dfn}. When the manual
refers to [Left]{.kbd .mod1 .mouse}, it means that you should first
press the []{.kbd .mod1n} key, carry out a left click while []{.kbd
.mod1n} is held down, and then finally release the key.

Available modifiers depend on your platform:

### Linux Modifiers

- [Ctrl]{.kbd} (Control)
- [Shift]{.kbd}
- [Alt]{.kbd}
- [Win]{.kbd} (Super/Windows)

### macOS Modifiers {#mac-modifiers}

- [Cmd]{.kbd} (Command, \"windmill\")
- [Ctrl]{.kbd} (Control)
- [Alt]{.kbd} (Option)
- [Shift]{.kbd}

## Scroll Wheel

Ardour can make good use of a [scroll wheel]{.dfn} on the mouse
(assuming it has one), which can be utilized for a variety of purposes.
Scroll wheels generate vertical scroll events, [⇑]{.kbd .mouse}
(ScrollUp) and [⇓]{.kbd .mouse} (ScrollDown). Some also emit horizontal
events, [⇐]{.kbd .mouse} (ScrollLeft) and [⇒]{.kbd .mouse}
(ScrollRight).

When appropriate, Ardour will differentiate between these two different
scroll axes. Otherwise it will interpret ScrollDown and ScrollLeft as
equivalent and similarly interpret ScrollUp and ScrollRight as
equivalent.

Typically, scroll wheel input is used to adjust [continuous
controls]{.dfn} such as faders and knobs, or to scroll vertically or
horizontally inside a window. In most [continuous control]{.dfn} cases,
holding down the [Ctrl]{.kbd} key while scrolling will use \"fine\" mode
and the scroll wheel increments will then be 10% of normal.
