# KDE Plasma 5
Under [KDE Plasma 5]{.dfn}, plugin and various other windows will not
stay on top of any main window; therefore a workaround is required.

## Workaround for ancillary windows not staying on top in KDE Plasma 5 {#workaround}

In order to force ancillary windows in Ardour to stay on top, the
following steps are necessary:

1.  Launch the [System Settings]{.kbd .menu} application.
2.  Open [Workspace \> Window Management]{.kbd .menu}.
3.  Select [Window Rules]{.kbd .menu} in the left-hand sidebar. It
    should default to the [Window matching]{.kbd .menu} tab.
4.  Click on the [New...]{.kbd .menu} button.
5.  On the line that says [Window class (application)]{.kbd .menu}, set
    the combo box to [Substring Match]{.kbd .menu} and type
    [ardour]{.kbd .user} in the text entry field.
6.  In the list box that is labeled [Window types:]{.kbd .menu}, click
    on the option [Dialog Window]{.kbd .menu}, then press and hold
    [Ctrl]{.kbd} while clicking on the second option [Utility
    Window]{.kbd .menu}.
7.  Select the [Arrangement & Access]{.kbd .menu} tab.
8.  Check the box next to the [Keep above]{.kbd .menu} option. On the
    same line, select [Force]{.kbd .menu} from the combo box, then click
    on the [Yes]{.kbd .menu} radio button for that line.
9.  Click on the [OK]{.kbd .menu} button to dismiss the dialog.

At this point the [System Settings]{.kbd .menu} application can be
closed.

### Background Info {#bg-info}

[According to one of the lead KDE
developers](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172615#c26), they are
not willing to follow the [ICCCM]{.abbr
title="Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual"} standard for
utility windows. Apparently they are alone in this understanding, as
plugin windows on Ardour under Linux work out of the box on every other
[WM]{.abbr title="Window Manager"} out there.

Under KDE 4, there was a workaround in Ardour ([Preferences \> Theme \>
All floating windows are dialogs]{.kbd .menu}) that would \"trick\" KDE
into forcing certain window types to be on top of their parent windows,
but this no longer works under KDE Plasma 5.
