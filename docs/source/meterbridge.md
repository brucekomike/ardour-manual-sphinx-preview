# Meterbridge
Meterbridge is a compact view of all meters in a session. It is designed
to assist for large recording sessions, particularly live recording
where the amount of mics is too large to get a good overview of the
entire session in either the [Mixer]{.kbd .window} or the
[Recorder]{.kbd .window} window.

By default, the Meterbridge window displays a meter per each track with
the track\'s name at the bottom and allows resetting the meter\'s peak
as well as arm a track for recording.

Each meter has a right-click menu to select the type of the meter. Just
like in the mixer channel view, tracks and regular audio busses default
to [Peak (+6 dBFS)]{.kbd .option} and the master bus defaults to [K14
(RMS)]{.kbd .option}. It\'s also possible to set the same meter type to
all same-type tracks.

Additionally, it\'s possible to select the height of the track name
panel by right-clicking above it and selecting one of the options going
from Short to Venti (which is a coffee cup size reference).

Just like in the usual mixer channel view, the [Arm for Recording]{.kbd
.button} button has a right-click menu to enable rec-safe mode to avoid
accidental recording to a track of choice.

The set of readily available controls can be customized per each session
on the [Meterbridge]{.kbd .window} page of the [Session Properties]{.kbd
.window} dialog.

Additional controls include:

- Mute button
- Solo button
- Monitor buttons
- Fader as a gain knob

It\'s also possible to toggle visibility of MIDI tracks, busses, and the
master bus.
