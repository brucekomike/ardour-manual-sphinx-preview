The [List Editor]{.dfn} is a way to look at the MIDI data of a region,
not graphically as they are displayed in the Editor, but in a tabular
form. This way of seeing the MIDI data allows for quicker \"debugging\"
of a MIDI region, and for fast *non-graphical* (i.e. no mouse involved)
editing. The list has a vertical flow, i.e. the first events (in time)
are at the top of the window, and the last are at the bottom.

It is accessed by selecting the [Region \> MIDI \> List Editor...]{.kbd
.menu} menu while having one MIDI region selected, or by [Right]{.kbd
.mouse} clicking the MIDI region and choosing [*Name_Of_The_Region* \>
MIDI \> List Editor...]{.kbd .menu}.

The window displays the following MIDI data:

  --------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Start     the timestamp of the start of the note
  Channel   the MIDI channel of the event
  Num       The [MIDI number](@@midi-notes-ref) of the note
  Name      The MIDI name of the note, made of its English name and octave (e.g. \"C4\")
  Vel       the velocity of the note, i.e. its volume, between 0 (silent) and 127 (full)
  Length    duration of the note, either expressed as a number (in ticks, related to the tempo) or as a text (fraction of a beat, also related to the tempo)
  --------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the top of the window is a [Sound Selected MIDI Notes]{.kbd .menu}
button, which toggles playing a note as it is selected.

Each value can be manually modified, by [left]{.kbd .mouse} clicking it.
However, the *Name* field is derived from the *Number* field, and cannot
be edited. To change a note, its number must be changed, which will be
reflected in the *Name* field.
