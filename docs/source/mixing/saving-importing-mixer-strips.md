# Saving and Importing Mixer Strips
## Reusing Mixer Strips

It\'s possible to reuse mixer strips in other sessions. This involves
importing:

trim gain;

all plugin parameters;

pin connections;

fader position and value.

Other settings of the affected internal tracks/busses are retained.

The three available options for loading processing from mixer strips
are:

- Local strip templates: these templates are saved into the current
  session\'s folder.
- Global strip templates: these templates are saved into the user\'s
  local folder with Ardour settings.
- Ardour sessions: processing is extracted from arbitrary Ardour
  sessions on the disk and applied to existing tracks/busses or imported
  as new tracks/busses.

## Saving Mixer Strips

To save mixer strips for further reuse, select track and busses whose
processing you want to save, then choose [Session \> Save Mixer
Strips...]{.kbd .menu}. In the newly opened dialog:

1.  Select whether you want to export mixer strips from the entire
    session or just the selected tracks/busses.
2.  Select whether you want to export a local or a global strip
    template.
3.  Provide the name for the template.
4.  Click [OK]{.kbd .key}.

## Importing Mixer Strips

To load mixer strips, select [Session \> Import Mixer Strips...]{.kbd
.menu}, then pick an arbitrary session from disk, one of the recently
opened sessions, or other global or local strip template.

Once you select the source of mixer strips, Ardour will display the
number of tracks in either the session or the strip template. Click
[Forward]{.kbd .key} to continue.

At the next step, Ardour allows you to map internal strips (already
available in the session) and external strips (from the selected Ardour
session or strip template).

![Mapping Mixer Strips](/images/map-mixer-strips.png){width="400px"}

The [Local track/bus]{.dfn} columns is a list of tracks and busses in
the currently opened session. Ardour defaults to displaying pairs of
internal tracks/busses and externals states with matching names. Other
tracks can be selected from the drop-down list below. Selecting \"\--
New Track \--\" will create a new track with a mixer strip selected on
the right.

The [External State]{.dfn} column is a list of mixer strips available in
either selected Ardour session or local/global template.

For a new pair of internal track/bus and external state, click the
[+]{.kbd .key} button to add the mapping to the list.

The [Actions]{.dfn} drop-down list contains three shortcuts:

- [Clear Mapping]{.dfn} removes all mappings between internal
  tracks/busses and external states.
- [Import all as new tracks]{.dfn} removes all mappings and creates new
  ones where all external tracks and busses are imported as new tracks.
- [Import visible as new tracks]{.dfn} removes all mappings and creates
  new ones where only visible external tracks and busses are imported as
  new tracks.
- [Reset]{.dfn} restores default mappings (tracks and busses with
  matching names).

The [Show all local tracks]{.dfn} toggle enabled displaying all
available tracks and busses in the currently opened session rather than
the the first three ones by default.

Click [OK]{.kbd .key} to complete importing mixer strips to the current
session.
