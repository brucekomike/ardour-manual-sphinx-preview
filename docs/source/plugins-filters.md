# Filters and Effects
## ACE Compressor

The job of this filter is to make an audio recording perceivably louder
by reducing the dynamic range, that is, the difference between the
loudest and the quietest parts. ACE compressor lowers the volume of loud
sounds above a user-defined threshold measured in dB, then the gain of
all the sound gets increased to make up for lost loudness.

![ACE Compressor](/images/a-compressor.png){style="width:50%;"}

Available settings are:

- **Threshold**. This setting defines the loudness at which the
  compressor will start working.
- **Knee**. Whether the transition from uncompressed to compressed is
  soft or hard. The effect is more noticeable with larger ratios.
- **Ratio**. How much the gain is reduced above a certain threshold. If
  the ratio is e.g. 5:1, 5dB will become 1dB.
- **Attack**. How long (in ms) it takes to apply maximum compression.
- **Release**. How long it takes to return to zero compression.
- **Makeup Gain**. How much the overall level should be increased after
  reducing loud sections.
- **Sidechain**. Whether the effect should be activate by the loadness
  of audio signal in another track passing a certain threshold.

The plugin also provides an opt-out inline display that shows input
signal, threshold, and resulting gain reduction:

## ACE Expander

Contrary to compressors, expanders increase the dynamic range either by
making quite sounds quieter (downward expanders) or by making loud
sounds louder (upward expanders). *ACE Expander* is a downward expander.
It reduces the level of a signal below a user-defined threshold by
user-defined ratio, then optionally increases the overall gain to make
up for lost loudness.

![ACE Expander](/images/a-expander.png){style="width:50%;"}

Available settings are:

- **Attack**. How long (in ms) it takes to apply maximum reduction of
  the quiet sections.
- **Release**. How long it takes to stop reducing the quiet signal at
  all.
- **Knee**. Whether the transition from non-reduced to reduced signal
  level is soft or hard. The effect is more noticeable with larger
  ratios.
- **Ratio**. How much the gain is reduced below a certain threshold. If
  the ratio is e.g. 3:1, -10dB will become -30dB.
- **Threshold**. The loudness at which the expander will start working.
- **Makeup Gain**. How much the overall level should be increased after
  reducing quiet sections.
- **Sidechain**. Whether the effect should be activated by the loudness
  of audio signal in another track passing a certain threshold.

*ACE Expander* also comes with an inline widget for mixer channels that
displays the input signal level, the threshold, and the amount of
reduced signal.

## ACE Delay

Delay effects repeat original signal after a user-defined interval. In
*ACE Delay*, the interval is calculated from the tempo and the
divisor --- a musical time unit like a 1/4th note or a dotted 1/16th
note. When using a delay in music production, it\'s usually best to sync
to project\'s tempo, especially if there are tempo ramps in a song.

![ACE Delay](/images/a-delay.png){style="width:50%;"}

Available settings are:

- **Tempo**. Amount of beats per minute.
- **Sync**. This toggles the syncing to project\'s tempo.
- **Divisor**. The interval between the original sound and its delayed
  copy, expressed in whole or fractional notes (1/4th, 1/8th etc.)
- **Dotted**. When enabled, adds half the divisor unit to the delay
  interval, e.g. a 1/8th note becomes a dotted 1/8th note.
- **Time**. The final delay time expressed in milliseconds.
- **Feedback**. How much of the processed signal goes back into the
  delay effect\'s input.
- **Low-Pass Filter (LPF)**. This helps simulating analog delay effects
  where the repeated signal gets dull.
- **Invert**. This option inverts the polarity of the output signal.
- **Output Gain**. Reduces or increases the level of the output signal.

## ACE Reverb

A reverb effect emulates sound waves reflecting off the walls in a
closed space which could be a a small room or a cathedral. The effect is
usually applied to a \"dry\" audio recording, that is, one typically
made in a very small room with acoustic absorption treatment so that
there are little-to-no reflections. That way, a reverb effect makes the
most sense as it gives you a clean slate and more freedom to shape your
sound.

The *ACE Reverb* effect is a very simple one, based on early research to
artificial reverberation by Manfred Schroeder and Ben Logan ([see
here](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Schroeder_Reverberators.html)
for technical details). There are just two controls:

- **Blend**. This control changes the mix in favour of either \"dry\"
  unprocessed signal that is being fed into the effect or the \"wet\"
  processed by the effect. 0 means you only hear the unprocessed signal,
  1 mean you only hear the processed signal.
- **Room Size**. This control changes the size of the virtual room and
  therefore the amount of decay.

## ACE High/Low Pass Filter {#ace-high-low-pass-filter}

High-pass and low-pass filters reduce the signal below and above a
certain frequency respectively. The *ACE High/Low Pass* filter combines
the two filters in one.

![ACE High/Low Pass
Filter](/images/a-lpf-hpf.png){alt="Inline ACE High/Low Pass Filter display"
style="width:50%;"}

Each of the two bandpass filters has three controls:

- **Steepness**. How much the filter reduces the signal per each step
  (12dB/oct to 48dB/oct). Setting steepness to *Off* disables the filter
  entirely.
- **Cutoff frequency**. The base frequency where the filter begins
  cutting off the data.
- **Resonance**. How much the signal around the cutoff frequency is
  suppressed (lower values) or emphasized (higher values). The plugins
  defaults to 0.707 which roughly translates to \"do nothing\".

The plugin also comes with an inline display visualizing the effect that
the filters have.

## ACE EQ

Equalizers are commonly used to shape the sound, change timbre of an
instrument and generally help it sit better in a mix.

ACE EQ is a simple 4-band equalizer with a low and a high shelves. All
bands and shelves are optional and can be disabled by clicking on the
outer border of respective parameters boxes.

For each band it\'s possible to set the base frequency, the gain level,
and the bandwidth. The latter defines how much frequencies around the
base frequency are affected by the gain adjustment. In an example below,
the first band has the narrowest bandwidth of 0.1, and the third band
has the default banwidth of 1.0. While both bands have a gain of +10dB,
the first one is very narrow, but the third one is wide enough so that
changes begin affecting frequencies that belong to neighboring frequency
bands.

![ACE EQ bandwidths](/images/a-eq-bandwidths.png){style="width:50%;"}

There are three ways to adjust both frequency, gain, and bandwidth:

1.  **Directly on the diagram**. Dragging the band mark (1 through 4)
    left and right changes the frequency, dragging it up and down
    changes the gain. Scrolling the mouse wheel over the band mark
    changes the bandwidth.

2.  **In the bottom parameters boxes**. Scrolling the mouse wheel over a
    setting changes its value. This is also where and how the master
    output can be adjusted.

3.  **Numerically via the generic plugin UI**. This user interface can
    be displayed by right-clicking on the plugin in the mixer channel
    and choosing the *Edit with generic controls...* option.

ACE EQ also provides an inline display for mixer channels:

## ACE Notch Bank

This is a very basic harmonic filter that suppresses a user-defined
number of harmonics (stages) starting at a user-defined base frequency.
The filter is mostly useful as a demonstration for Ardour\'s built-in
biquadratic filter that can be used in Lua scripts.

![ACE Notch Bank](/images/ace-notch-bank.png){alt="ACE Notch bank"
style="width:50%;"}

An example below is a sine wave at 120Hz with added harmonics, each at a
lower magnitude than the previous one. Applying the ACE Notch Bank
filter starting at 120Hz with 8 stages completeles silences the signal
(the purple line for processed signal is not even visible):
