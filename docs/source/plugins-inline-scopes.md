# Inline Scopes
## ACE Inline Scope

track or streamed into track\'s input. The waveform moves downwards.

The scope has a few settings:

- **Timescale**. How many seconds of audio fit into the display at any
  time.
- **Height (Aspect)**. The aspect ratio of the inline display.

track or streamed into track\'s input.

The plugin has a number of options:

- **Logscale**. Whether the plugin should use a logarithmic rather than
  a linear scale.
- **1/f scale**. Whether the spectrum analyzer should adjust for 1/f aka
  \"pink noise\" to provide a more useful representation of the signal.
- **FFT size**. This is the frequency resolution. The more bins in
  analysis window, the better resolution.
- **Height (Aspect)**. The aspect ratio of the inline display.
- **Range**. The dynamic range of the spectrum analyzer in dB.
- **Offset**. Optional gain correction of the original signal if it\'s
  too quiet or too loud.

There are several options:

- **Hexadecimal**. Whether values should be displayed in hexadecimal
  notation, e.g. 1E00 instead of 7680.
- **System messages**. Whether the Monitor should display system control
  and real-time messages
- **Numeric notes**. Whether the Monitor should display notes in the
  numeric notation, e.g. 48 instead of C3.
- **Font size**. The font size used to display events.
- **Line count**. How many lines the MIDI MOnitor should display in the
  mixer strip.

## LTC Reader

This is a Linear Timecode (LTC) decoder with an inline display in the
mixer strip. It can display either the LTC data from regions in a track
or any LTC data streamed into track\'s input.
