The built-in perceptual analyzer allows one to visualize the live
spectrum of multiple tracks and/or busses.

The overlaid visualization of multiple sources helps discover which
track contributes a given of frequency range to the overall mix, find
conflicting ranges or holes in the spectrum.

## Adding sources to analysis

By default, the real-time analyzer (RTA) window displays the spectrum of
the signal coming out of the master bus. To add more sources, toggle the
RTA button on either the Editor Mixer or the channel strip in the Mixer
window. This will add a new source to the analyzer and open the RTA
window.

## Reading the spectrum display

The perceptual analyzer displays how much power (dB) each part of the
sound spectrum (Hz) contains. The horizontal axis represents frequency
from low (20Hz) on the left to high (20kHz) on the right, while the
vertical axis shows power level going from 0dB at the top to -60dB at
the bottom.

By default, the RTA window displays values in the 0dB..-60dB range. To
see the opposite ends of the power range (0db to 6ddB and -60dB to
-80dB), hover over the right side of the dialog and use the scrollbar.

You can also drag the top and the bottom ends of the scrollbar position
indicator to zoom in and out.

Taller \"peaks\" indicate frequencies with more power, while \"valleys\"
show frequencies with less power.

Hovering over the chart displays the frequency/power pair at the bottom
of the dialog numerically.

As audio plays, the display updates continuously. It\'s possible to
temporarily pause the visual update of the spectrum display to inspect
it in detail. There are two ways to do it:

- Left-click and hold freezes pauses the update until you release the
  mouse button. This is useful when you only need a quick inspection.
- Clicking on the [Freeze]{.kbd} button pauses the update until you
  click the button again. This is useful when you need to go into
  details and hover spectrograph to see the frequency/

## Removing sources from analysis

To remove selected sources from analysis, toggle the RTA button in
respective mixer channels.

To remove all sources except the master bus, click on the [Clear]{.kbd}
button in the RTA window.

## Real-time analyzer options

The real-time analyzer has two options:

- [Speed]{.dfn}: Sets the analysis return time, or how many dBs fall in
  a given period, from 1dB in 2 seconds for the Noise Measurement mode
  to 96dB/s for the Fast mode.
- [Warp]{.dfn}: Warps spectrum frequencies to focus on given range. A
  high warp factor increases resolution in the low frequency range,
  while the Bark scale is a frequency scale on which equal distances
  correspond with perceptually equal distances.

## Controlling RTA performance

Real-time spectrum analysis is CPU-intensive. You can control how many
spectrum displays Ardour should attempt to handle simultaneously. The
[Limit concurrent RTA spectra]{.kbd .menu} setting is available on the
Metering page of the Preferences dialog.
