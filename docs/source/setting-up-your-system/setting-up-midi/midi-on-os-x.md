# MIDI on OS X
In order for CoreMIDI to work with Jack MIDI, a CoreMIDI-to-JACK-MIDI
[bridge]{.dfn} is required. This feature is available on versions equal
to or greater than version 0.89 of JackOSX.

## Routing MIDI

### Inside Ardour

MIDI ports show up in Ardour\'s MIDI connection matrix in multiple
locations. Bridged CoreMIDI ports as well as JACK MIDI ports that have
been created by other software clients will show up under the \"Other\"
tab. Bridged CoreMIDI hardware ports show up under the \"Hardware\" tab.

### External Applications {#external-apps}

There are multiple options for connecting MIDI ports outside of Ardour.

- [MIDI Monitor](http://www.snoize.com/MIDIMonitor/) is a handy tool for
  doing various MIDI-related tasks.
- [MIDI Patchbay](http://notahat.com/midi_patchbay/) allows connection
  of ports and filters MIDI data.
