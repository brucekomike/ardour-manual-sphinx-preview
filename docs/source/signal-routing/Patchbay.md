The [patchbay]{.dfn} is the main way to make connections to, from and
within Ardour\'s mixer.

Notable exceptions are internal aux sends and connections to the monitor
bus (when using one): these cannot be controlled from a patchbay, and
are basically not under manual control at all.

The patchbay presents two groups of ports; one set of [sources]{.dfn}
(which produce data), and one of [destinations]{.dfn} (which consume
data). Depending on the relative number of each, the sources will be
placed on the left or the top of the dialogue, and the destinations on
the right or the bottom. Thus, in general, signal flow is from top or
left to right or bottom.

Both sources and destinations are divided up into groups, with each
group being given a tab:

  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Hardware      These are ports which are connected to a physical piece of hardware (a sound card or MIDI interface).
  Ardour Misc   These are other ports that do not fit into the previous two categories; for example, the ports on which the metronome click is output, and MIDI ports for things like control surfaces and timecode.
  I/O Pre       All ports of I/O Pre-Process Plugins.
  I/O Post      All ports of I/O Post-Process Plugins.
  Tracks        All ports belonging to tracks.
  Busses        All ports belonging to busses.
  Other         If the Jack backend is being used and if there are other JACK clients running, their ports will be found here. If there are no such ports, the tab will not exist (on one or both axes of the grid).
  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main part of the patchbay is a [matrix grid]{.dfn}. Within this
grid, green dots represent connections, and any of the squares can be
clicked on to make or break connections. Clicking and dragging draws a
line of connections, which is sometimes useful for making many
connections at once.

In the example patchbay shown above we can note various things. We are
using the [Ardour Tracks]{.kbd .menu} sources tab, so we see the output
ports of the three tracks in our session: Fred, Jim and Foo. Our
destinations are from the [Ardour Busses]{.kbd .menu} tab, so we have
the inputs of a session bus, Sheila, and the inputs of the master bus.
Fred and Jim have stereo outputs, so have L and R connections. Foo is a
MIDI track, so it only has one connection, and its squares in the grid
are coloured light grey to indicate that no connection can be made
between Foo (a MIDI output) and our busses (which are all audio-input).

The green dots in the example show that both Fred and Jim are connected
to the master bus, left to left and right to right.

## Variants on the Patchbay

Slightly different versions of the patchbay are available from different
places in Ardour. A global view of all audio connections is available,
in [Window \> Audio Connections]{.kbd .menu}, or by pressing [P]{.kbd
.mod2}. A corresponding MIDI Connection Manager can be opened using
[P]{.kbd .mod23}.

There is also a patchbay available when connecting individual tracks;
clicking on the input or output buttons of a mixer strip will open a
connection manager which has the corresponding track input or output as
the only destination or source, with all other ports available for
connection to it.

## Other patchbay features

[right]{.kbd .mouse}-clicking on a port name in the connection manager
opens a context menu which provides a few handy options:

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  [Add audio port]{.kbd .menu}\       These options add audio or MIDI
  and\                                ports to the clicked source, if
  [Add MIDI port]{.kbd .menu}         this is possible. In this way, for
                                      example, tracks and busses can be
                                      extended to have more inputs or
                                      outputs.

  [Remove *port_name*]{.kbd .menu}    Removes the given port, if
                                      possible. [Right]{.kbd .mouse
                                      .mod3}-clicking a port will do the
                                      same.

  [Disconnect all from                Disconnects everything from the
  *port_name*]{.kbd .menu}            given port.

  [Rescan]{.kbd .menu}                If Ardour is using the JACK
                                      backend, Ardour will try to keep
                                      abreast of any changes to the JACK
                                      ports on the system, and reflect
                                      them in any connection managers
                                      which are open. If for some reason
                                      this fails, this can be used to
                                      re-scan the list of ports and
                                      update the manager.

  [Show individual ports]{.kbd .menu} If a session has lots of
                                      multi-channel tracks or busses, it
                                      may be an unnecessary detail that
                                      left has to be connected to left
                                      and right to right every time a
                                      connection is made. This obviously
                                      gets worse with higher channel
                                      counts (such as for 5.1 or
                                      Ambisonics). To make life easier
                                      with such sessions, Show individual
                                      ports can be unticked. After that,
                                      the channels of tracks and busses
                                      will be hidden, and any green dots
                                      added in the connection manager
                                      will automatically connect each
                                      channel of the source to the
                                      corresponding channel of the
                                      destination (left to left, right to
                                      right and so on). In this mode, a
                                      half-circle in the connection grid
                                      indicates that some (but not all)
                                      of the source\'s ports are
                                      connected to the destination.

  [Flip]{.kbd .menu}                  This will flip the visible ports on
                                      the vertical axis with those on the
                                      horizontal. If, for example, the
                                      top of the connection manager is
                                      showing [Ardour Busses]{.kbd .menu}
                                      and the right is showing
                                      [Hardware]{.kbd .menu}, flip will
                                      swap the view to the opposite.
                                      Flipping can also be done by
                                      pressing [f]{.kbd}. Note that if
                                      there are no matching tabs on both
                                      axes, flipping will be impossible.
