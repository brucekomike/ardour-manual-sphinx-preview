# Latency and Latency-Compensation
[[Latency]{.dfn}](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_%28audio%29) is a
system\'s reaction time to a given stimulus. There are many factors that
contribute to the total latency of a system. In order to achieve exact
time synchronization all sources of latency need to be taken into
account and compensated for.

## Sources of Latency

### Sound propagation through the air {#sound-propagation}

Since sound is a mechanical perturbation in a fluid, it travels at
comparatively slow [speed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound)
of about 340 m/s. As a consequence, an acoustic guitar or piano has a
latency of about 1--2 ms, due to the propagation time of the sound
between the instrument and the player\'s ear.

### Digital-to-Analog and Analog-to-Digital conversion {#dac-adc}

Electric signals travel quite fast (on the order of the speed of light),
so their propagation time is negligible in this context. But the
conversions between the analog and digital domain take a comparatively
long time to perform, so their contribution to the total latency may be
considerable on otherwise very low-latency systems. Conversion delay is
usually below 1 ms.

### Digital Signal Processing {#dsp}

Digital processors tend to process audio in chunks, and the size of that
chunk depends on the needs of the algorithm and performance/cost
considerations. This is usually the main cause of latency when using a
computer and the one that can be predicted and optimized.

### Computer I/O Architecture {#io-arch}

A computer is a general purpose processor, not a digital audio
processor. This means the audio data has to jump a lot of fences in its
path from the outside to the CPU and back, contending in the process
with some other parts of the system vying for the same resources (CPU
time, bus bandwidth, etc.)

## The Latency Chain {#latency-chain}

Note! the rest of this document assumes the use of jackd for the audio
backend. While many of the concepts are true, the specifics may be
different.

![Latency chain](/images/latency-chain.png){.invert-in-dark}

The numbers are an example for a typical PC. With professional gear and
an optimized system the total round-trip latency is usually lower. The
important point is that latency is always additive and a sum of many
independent factors.

Processing latency is usually divided into [capture latency]{.dfn} (the
time it takes for the digitized audio to be available for digital
processing, usually one audio period), and [playback latency]{.dfn} (the
time it takes for the audio that has been processed to be available in
digital form). In practice, the combination of both matters. It is
called [round-trip latency]{.dfn}: the time necessary for a certain
audio event to be captured, processed and played back.

It is important to note that processing latency in Ardour is a matter of
choice. It can be lowered within the limits imposed by the hardware
(audio device, CPU and bus speed) and audio driver. Lower latencies
increase the load on the system because it needs to process the audio in
smaller chunks which arrive much more frequently. The lower the latency,
the more likely the system will fail to meet its processing deadline and
the dreaded [xrun]{.dfn} (short for buffer over- or under-run) will make
its appearance more often, leaving its merry trail of clicks, pops and
crackles.

The digital I/O latency is usually negligible for integrated or
[PCI]{.abbr title="Periphal Component Interface"} audio devices, but for
USB or FireWire interfaces the bus clocking and buffering can add some
milliseconds.

## Low Latency Use Cases {#ll-use-cases}

Low latency is **not** always a feature one wants to have. It comes with
a couple of drawbacks: the most prominent is increased power consumption
because the CPU needs to process many small chunks of audio data, it is
constantly active and can not enter power-saving mode (think fan noise).
Since each application that is part of the signal chain must run in
every audio cycle, low-latency systems will undergo [context
switches]{.dfn} between applications more often, which incur a
significant overhead. This results in a much higher system load and an
increased chance of xruns.

For a few applications, low latency is critical:

### Playing virtual instruments

A large delay between the pressing of the keys and the sound the
instrument produces will throw off the timing of most instrumentalists
(save church organists, whom we believe to be awesome
latency-compensation organic systems.)

### Software audio monitoring {#software-monitoring}

If a singer is hearing her own voice through two different paths, her
head bones and headphones, even small latencies can be very disturbing
and manifest as a tinny, irritating sound.

### Live effects {#live-fx}

Low latency is important when using the computer as an effect rack for
inline effects such as compression or EQ. For reverbs, slightly higher
latency might be tolerable, if the direct sound is not routed through
the computer.

### Live mixing

Some sound engineers use a computer for mixing live performances.
Basically that is a combination of the above: monitoring on stage,
effects processing and EQ.

In many other cases, such as playback, recording, overdubbing, mixing,
mastering, etc. latency is not important, since it can easily be
compensated for.

To explain that statement: During mixing or mastering, one doesn\'t care
if it takes 10ms or 100ms between the instant the play button is pressed
and the sound coming from the speaker. The same is true when recording
with a count in.

## Latency compensation

During tracking it is important that the sound that is currently being
played back is internally aligned with the sound that is being recorded.

This is where latency compensation comes into play. There are two ways
to compensate for latency in a DAW, [read-ahead]{.dfn} and
[write-behind]{.dfn}. The DAW starts playing a bit early (relative to
the playhead), so that when the sound arrives at the speakers a short
time later, it is exactly aligned with the material that is being
recorded. Since we know that playback has latency, the incoming audio
can be delayed by the same amount to line things up again.

The second approach is prone to various implementation issues regarding
timecode and transport synchronization. Ardour uses read-ahead to
compensate for latency. The time displayed in the Ardour clock
corresponds to the audio signal that is heard on the speakers (and is
not where Ardour reads files from disk).

As a side note, this is also one of the reasons why many projects start
at timecode `01:00:00:00`{.sample}. When compensating for output latency
the DAW will need to read data from before the start of the session, so
that the audio arrives in time at the output when the timecode hits
`01:00:00:00`{.sample}. Ardour does handle the case of
`00:00:00:00`{.sample} properly but not all systems/software/hardware
that you may inter-operate with may behave the same.

## Latency Compensation And Clock Sync

To achieve sample accurate timecode synchronization, the latency
introduced by the audio setup needs to be known and compensated for.

In order to compensate for latency, JACK or JACK applications need to
know exactly how long a certain signal needs to be read-ahead or
delayed:

![Jack Latency
Compensation](/images/jack-latency-excerpt.png){.invert-in-dark}

In the figure above, clients A and B need to be able to answer the
following two questions:

- How long has it been since the data read from port Ai or Bi arrived at
  the edge of the JACK graph (capture)?
- How long will it be until the data written to port Ao or Bo arrives at
  the edge of the JACK graph (playback)?

JACK features an [API]{.abbr title="Application Programming Interface"}
that allows applications to determine the answers to above questions.
However JACK can not know about the additional latency that is
introduced by the computer architecture, operating system and soundcard.
These values can be specified by the JACK command line parameters
[-I]{.kbd .input} and [-O]{.kbd .input} and vary from system to system
but are constant on each. On a general purpose computer system the only
way to accurately learn about the total (additional) latency is to
measure it.

## Calibrating JACK Latency

Linux DSP guru Fons Adriaensen wrote a tool called [jack_delay]{.dfn} to
accurately measure the round-trip latency of a closed loop audio chain,
with sub-sample accuracy. JACK itself includes a variant of this tool
called [jack_iodelay]{.dfn}.

Jack_iodelay allows to measure the total latency of the system,
subtracts the known latency of JACK itself and suggests values for
jackd\'s audio-backend parameters.

jack\_\[io\]delay works by emitting some rather annoying tones,
capturing them again after a round trip through the whole chain, and
measuring the difference in phase so it can estimate with great accuracy
the time taken.

The loop can be closed in a number of ways:

- Putting a speaker close to a microphone. This is rarely done, as air
  propagation latency is well known so there is no need to measure it.
- Connecting the output of the audio interface to its input using a
  patch cable. This can be an analog or a digital loop, depending on the
  nature of the input/output used. A digital loop will not factor in the
  [AD/DA]{.abbr title="Analog to Digital, Digital to Analog"} converter
  latency.

Once the loop has been closed, one must:

1.  Launch jackd with the configuration to test.
2.  Launch [jack_delay]{.kbd .input} on the command line.
3.  Make the appropriate connections between the jack ports so the loop
    is closed.
4.  Adjust the playback and capture levels in the mixer.

On Linux, the latency of USB audio interfaces is not constant. It may
change when the interface is reconnected, on reboot and even when xruns
occur. This is due the buffer handling in the Linux USB stack. As a
workaround, it is possible to recalibrate the latency at the start of
each session and each time an xrun occurs.
