# Transport Masters
The [Transport Masters]{.dfn} dialog allows selecting a transport master
(a timecode source) for Ardour to sync to, as well as tweaking
additional settings.

![Transport Masters](/images/transport-masters.png){style="width:75%;"}

Supported protocols are:

- JACK Transport
- MIDI Time Code (MTC)
- Linear (or Longitudinal) Timecode (LTC)
- MIDI Beat Clock, or MIDI Clock

For each type of supported protocol it\'s possible to select the port to
read timecode signal from, view sync position and drift (delta), see
when any message was received the last time, and toggle additional
options.\`

## Selecting a Transport Master {#selecting-transport-master}

The dialog collects all transport masters information and settings in
one place, however Ardour can sync only to one timecode source at a
time. Clicking the radio button to the left of the master\'s name
selects that transport master.

It is necessary to also select an audio or MIDI port (depending on the
protocol) to read timecode data from. Relevant ports are listed for each
transport master in the dropdown list in the [Source]{.dfn} section.

## Keeping Track of Sync

[Format]{.dfn} displays the timecode format for each transport master
depending on the specifics of that master\'s protocol. E.g. while MTC
and LTC will display a frame rate such as 25 fps, MIDI Clock will be
transmitting tempo such as 120 beats per minute.

[Sync Position + Delta]{.dfn} displays current location as per timecode
as well as the difference between current location in Ardour and the
location per timecode source. This difference (delta) accumulates as
long as Ardour\'s transport isn\'t rolling.

[Last Message + Age]{.dfn} displays the latest location transmitted by
the timecode source, as well as the time since the last transmission was
received.

## Additional Options

It\'s possible to set several additional options.

[Active Commands]{.dfn} makes it possible to perform certain types of
actions in Ardour at the cost of decoupling from the transport master.
Supported options are:

- Accept start/stop commands (displays \'Start/Stop\' on the button)
- Accept speed-changing commands (displays \'Speed\' on the button)
- Accept locate commands (displays \'Locate\' on the button)

When only one command is enabled, its short name will displayed at the
button\'s caption (see above). When two out of three are enabled, the
button\'s caption will be \'Complex\'. When all three options are
enabled, the caption will be \'All\'.

The easiest way to select two or three options at a time is to open the
drop-down menu, use arrow up/down keys to navigate to the option of
interest, the press [Spacebar]{.kbd .button} to toggle that option
without subsequently closing the drop-down menu.

[Clock Synced]{.dfn} --- when this option is enabled, the external
timecode source is assumed to be sample-clock synced to the audio
interface that is being used by Ardour

[29.97/30]{.dfn} --- when this option is enabled, the external timecode
source is assumed to use 29.97 fps exactly rather than 30000/1001 (which
is 29.97002997).

Both [Clock Synced]{.dfn} and [29.97/30]{.dfn} options are not
applicable to [MIDI Beat Clock]{.dfn} that operates in the musical time
domain and transmits beats per minute rather that seconds and frames.

## Adding and Removing Custom Transport Masters {#add-remove-custom-masters}

It is possible to [add]{.dfn} additional masters of the same type, e.g.
two difference sources of LTC.

Clicking [Add a New Transport Master]{.kbd .button} opens a new dialog.

master](/images/add-transport-master.png){style="width:50%;"}

It\'s usually a good idea to give the custom transport master a
descriptive name, especially if there are multiple ones available using
the same protocol.

The next step is selecting the audio or MIDI port where the timecode
signal will be coming from.

Additional transport masters can be [removed]{.dfn} with a single click.
Every custom transport master has a button with a crosshair icon
[X]{.kbd .button} to the right of the window. No confirmation will be
asked upon clicking this button.
