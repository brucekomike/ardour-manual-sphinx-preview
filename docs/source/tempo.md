# Tempo
The Tempo ruler allows changing tempo within one session, either
abruptly or gradually over time. This is done by placing tempo markers
on the ruler and setting up how exactly the transition happens.
Alternatively, in the [Grid mode](/ardours-interface/the-toolbox#grid),
markers can be added and edited directly on the timeline.

On the screenshot below, there are 4 bars of music at 120bpm starting at
bar 27, then the tempo changes abruptly to 140bpm and goes on for
another 4 bars at that tempo, then abruptly changes back to 120bpm and
within the next 4 bars gradually goes back to 140bpm, then continues at
140bpm until the end of the session.

## Anatomy of tempo markers

Each tempo marker exposes several editable properties:

- BPM at the start, sets a new tempo value.
- BPM at the end *(only available for gradual transitions)*, defines the
  tempo value at the end of a tempo ramp.
- Tempo (transition) type, defines whether the tempo is the same
  (constant) until the next tempo marker or whether it gradually changes
  (ramps up or down) towards the next tempo.
- Location of the tempo marker, defined in musical time.
- Lock style, defines whether tempo is locked to musical time (bars and
  beats) or real time (minutes and seconds).

## Working with tempo markers on the ruler

### Adding Tempo Markers

To add a tempo marker, hover a bar or a beat line, press [Ctrl]{.kbd}
and single-click. Newly created tempo marker will have the same tempo
value as the previous one.

## Shifting tempo markers

To change the position of a tempo change, do one of the two things:

- Click and drag a marker left or right. Ardour will increment the
  change by one beat.
- Double-click the marker or right-click it and choose [Edit]{.kbd
  .menu} to open the marker properties dialog, then change the bar and
  the beat where tempo change should occur.

### Editing tempo value

The tempo start value can be changed directly on the timeline or using
the tempo marker properties dialog.

To change the tempo value directly on the timeline, hover the marker,
press [Ctrl]{.kbd}, and drag the marker left or right. The bpm start
value will change, and the grid will be adjusted accordingly.

Alternatively, double-click the marker or right-click it and choose
[Edit]{.kbd .menu} to open the marker properties dialog, then change the
\"Start beats per minute\" value.

Additionally, you can set the new tempo by tapping it in one of the two
ways:

- By repeatedly clicking the [Tap tempo]{.kbd .button} button in the
  dialog.
- By selecting a connected MIDI keyboard and repeatedly pressing either
  a piano key or a silicon pad.

In some cases, an existing tempo marker needs to get the same value as
the tempo marker before it, typically to start a ramp. To do that,
right-click the tempo marker that needs to change and select the
[Continue]{.kbd .menu} menu item.

### Constant vs ramped tempo

The tempo between two tempo markers with different bpm start values can
stay the same (constant) or change gradually (ramped).

When the tempo type is constant, the line between two markers stays
horizontal:

![Constant tempo](/images/tempo-type-constant.png){style="width:75%;"
width="75%"}

When the tempo is ramped, the line between two markers is diagonal:

![Ramped tempo](/images/tempo-type-ramped.png){style="width:75%;"
width="75%"}

The toggle between constant and ramped types is available in the tempo
marker properties menu and applies forward in the timeline.
Alternatively, you can right-click a tempo marker and select the [Ramp
to Next]{.kbd .menu} menu item. Tempo will gradually accelerate or
decelerate until the target tempo is reached, resulting in a musical
*accel.* or *ritard.*

To switch from the ramped type to the constant type, either open the
tempo marker properties dialog and switch it, or right-click a tempo
marker and select the [Set Constant]{.kbd .menu} menu item. The tempo
will change abruptly at the next tempo marker.

### Removing Markers

To remove a tempo marker, either single-click it and press [Del]{.kbd}
or right-click it and select the [Remove]{.kbd .menu} menu item.

### Locking to music vs audio time

Audio-locked tempo markers stay in their frame position as their
neighbor\'s positions are altered. Their pulse (musical) position will
change as their neighbors move. Music-locked tempo markers move their
frame position as their neighbors are moved, but keep their pulse
position (they will move as the music is moved).

## Working with tempo markers in the Grid mode

For documentation on editing the tempo map in the Grid mode, please see
the [relevant part](/ardours-interface/the-toolbox#grid) of the Toolbox
chapter.
