Although all the process of recording an audio or MIDI performance can
be done in any mode, the [Recorder]{.dfn} provides a synoptic view of
most parameters and actions related to capturing this performance, hence
giving more confidence in the final result.

The Recorder is another view on settings, parameters, and actions that
can be set or called in other modes. Any change done in the Recorder is
instantly reflected in e.g. the Editor, and vice versa.

The Recorder, being a mode, sports the same [main menu](@@main-menu),
[status bar](@@status-bar), and [toolbar](@@transport-bar) as the Editor
and Mixer. It adds a secondary toolbar, a simplified session view,
reminiscent of the Editor, and a global input panel.

## The Secondary Toolbar

The subsections below describe the secondary toolbar from left to right.

### Last Take Manager {#recorder_last_take_manager}

<figure class="left">
<img src="/images/recorder_last-take.png" alt="The Last Take Manager" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Last Take Manager</figcaption>
</figure>

This manager displays information about the last (or current) take :

- A *duration display*, that shows the duration of the last (or current)
  recording. It is always displayed as
  `hours:minutes:seconds:tenths`{.sample}, regardless of the [Transport
  clocks](@@transport-clocks) display settings.
- An x-run counter, an x-run being a buffer under(or over)flow. Each
  time such an x-run occurs, an artifact is recording, that can be
  audible or not, but is a red flag for the recording quality.
- A [Discard Last Take]{.kbd} button, that deletes the last finished
  recording(s), effectively removing the audio file(s) from the hard
  drive, hence destructive.

This last button cannot be used while recording, the transport must be
stopped. It also has no concept of history, and repeatedly clicking it
wont discard previous takes from last to first, in order to prevent
destroying good takes. Lastly, it does not reset the playhead position,
as the [Transport \> Stop and Forget Capture]{.kbd .menu} menu would.

### Global Arm {#recorder_global_arm}

<figure class="left">
<img src="/images/recorder_global-arm.png"
alt="The Global Arm options" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Global Arm options</figcaption>
</figure>

Like the *Monitor Options* below, these buttons apply to all the tracks
at once.

It is a convenient shortcut to arm ([All]{.kbd})/disarm ([None]{.kbd})
all the tracks for recording.

### Monitoring Options {#recorder_monitoring_options .clear}

<figure class="left">
<img src="/images/input-mode-buttons.png"
alt="The Monitoring options" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Monitoring options</figcaption>
</figure>

These buttons allow switching the monitoring mode globally, for all the
tracks at once. The monitoring mode allows to decide what the user wants
to be listening to, between:

- [All In]{.dfn}: all the tracks play what is on their *In*puts,
- [All Disk]{.dfn}: all the tracks play the actual content of the
  playlist on *Disk*,
- or [both]{.dfn}: also called \"cue monitoring\" if both buttons are
  engaged, a combination of the two modes above, where all the tracks
  play existing data from disk while also listening to the input signal.
  This is particularly useful for MIDI tracks, where one can hear a
  performance/new material while listening to the playback of existing
  material in the track.

The [Auto Input]{.kbd .menu} switch allows Ardour to auto-select what is
played, which is:

- When not playing: all tracks are on *In* (to listen to any connected
  source)
- When playing, all tracks are on *Disk* (to play whatever was recorded
  on those tracks)
- When recording, on rec-enabled tracks: *In* and on non rec-enabled
  ones: *Disk*

If Auto Input is disabled, then you will hear the Input being monitored
whenever a track is armed, even if you aren\'t actually recording. If
Auto Input is \_enabled\_, then you will hear playback when the
transport is rolling, and the tracks will only switch to Input when the
master-record arm is engaged (so you are actually recording).

### \'New Playlist\' buttons {#recorder_new_playlist}

<figure class="left">
<img src="/images/recorder_new-playlist.png"
alt="The &#39;New Playlist&#39; buttons" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The 'New Playlist' buttons</figcaption>
</figure>

Recording multiple takes can easily be done in Ardour by using
[playlists](@@understanding-playlists), as a track can have multiple
playlists and it is easy to [switch](@@playlist-operations) from one to
another.

The two buttons create new, \"blank\", playlists to record on:

- [New Playlist for All Tracks]{.kbd .menu} creates a new playlist for
  each visible track, while
- [New Playlist for Rec-Armed]{.kbd .menu} uses the [●]{.kbd
  style="color:red;"} recording status of each track to generate new
  playlists.

Creating new playlists is both cheap in terms of CPU and memory, and
easy to revert by changing the track\'s playlist back to its previous
one. Playlists on different tracks can also share the same name,
allowing for a better workflow when recording: Ardour suggests
*Take.*#n** as the name for each playlist, so that they stay somewhat
correlated.

### Disk space and Reset Peaks {#recorder_disk_space}

<figure class="left">
<img src="/images/recorder_disk-and-reset.png"
alt="Disk space &amp; Reset Peaks" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Disk space &amp; Reset Peaks</figcaption>
</figure>

- *Disk space* shows how many time or recoding is available on the
  current hard drive (i.e. the hard drive where the session is located),
  by accounting the bit depth, sampling rate, and number of armed
  tracks. The result is either a duration, or `>24h`{.sample} if it
  exceeds 24 hours.
- *Reset Peak Hold* clears the memory of the highest recording level in
  the meters located in the bottom input panel, and displayed with a
  green line.

## Tracks {#recorder_tracks}

The Simplified Session View is a view of the session, specifically
tailored for the purpose of recording, that is similar to the Editor (or
the [Summary](@@summary)) with notable differences, among which:

- it always encompasses the whole session in the time axis,
- the regions are displayed as blocks, not waveforms,
- no editing, like moving or resizing regions, is possible
- each track (or lane) has a fixed and narrow height

All those differences are consequences of the aim of this view, which is
to keep thing not too busy and clear in a recording context. The most
important settings related to the recording process are easily available
and to facilitate the work of the operator.

### Simplified Session View {#recorder_simplified_session}

![A track in the Recorder](/images/recorder_lane.png)

Each lane is made of (from left to right):

- A zone showing [grouping](@@track-and-bus-groups), as in the Editor,
  with the same functions and menus.
- A [●]{.kbd style="color:red;"} rec-arm button. When armed, the entire
  button will turn pink, and change to bright red as soon as the
  transport is rolling and the track is recording. [Right]{.kbd
  .mouse}-clicking will allow to en/disable *Rec-safe*, protecting the
  track against accidental recording.
- An [Input]{.kbd} button displaying the connected input(s) of the
  track. It is the same button as the *Input* button shown in the [Mixer
  strip](@@audiomidi-mixer-strips), and behaves exactly the same way
  ([Left]{.kbd .mouse}-clicking to show the input menu, [Right]{.kbd
  .mouse}-clicking shows the input connection matrix).
- A [P]{.kbd} playlist button displaying the connected input(s) of the
  track. Again, it is the same button as the one shown in the [Editor\'s
  track header](@@audio-track-controls), and behaves exactly the same
  way ([Left]{.kbd .mouse}-clicking to show the playlist menu).
- A [Track Name]{.kbd} label, displaying the track\'s name.[Double]{.kbd
  .mouse}-clicking allows to edit (rename) the track.
- Two [In]{.kbd} and [Disk]{.kbd} buttons allowing to set this
  particular track\'s monitoring option, as described above.
- *N* level meters showing the input level of the track, as in the
  [Editor\'s track header](@@audio-track-controls), *N* being the number
  of input channels of the track.
- A [*n*]{.kbd style="background:yellow;"} numbered button, using the
  [track\'s color](@@track-color) as background color. Numbering can be
  useful when using OSC, a MIDI controller, or when recording multiple
  performances at once.
- An overview of the track\'s content, with solid blocks representing
  regions. The region\'s color is the track color, except while
  recording where the recorded regions are displayed in red.

Like in the Editor or Mixer, a [new track, bus or
VCA](@@adding-tracks-busses-and-vcas) can be created by either
[double]{.kbd .mouse} or [right]{.kbd .mouse}-clicking on an empty place
in the track list.

### The Global Input Panel {#recorder_global_input_channel}

This panel lists all the audio and MIDI system inputs.

![An audio input](/images/recorder_input-panel.png)

The inputs are displayed either vertically or horizontally based on the
[Preferences](@@preferences#preferences-appearance-recorder).

If an input is used by a track that is armed for recording, it sports a
red frame.

The controls on each input are:

- a [(1)]{.kbd} button indicating how many tracks are fed by this input.
  Clicking this button will show only those tracks.
- a [+]{.kbd} button, allowing to create a track that will be
  automatically connected to this input. The type of track (MIDI or
  aurio) depends on the input type.
- a [PFL]{.kbd} button, or *Pre-Fader Listen*, active only if [Use
  monitor section in this session]{.kbd .option} is checked in the
  [Session Properties](@@session-properties#properties-monitoring). When
  active, sends the soloed signal to the [Monitor](@@monitor-section).
- a [Input\'s Name]{.kbd} button. Inputs can be named or renamed at
  will, to ease the recognition of e.g. one microphone in a multi-track
  recording, like a multi-instrumentalist performance, by clicking the
  button. Ardour stores this name for the device, so any later session
  using this input will show this label.

The right hand side of the input depends on the kind of input, either
audio or MIDI. For an audio track:

- a live level-meter for this input that shows the current level of the
  audio signal. A green line marks the *Peak Hold*, i.e. the maximum
  level reached on this input.
- a continuous waveform, showing the input state during the last 5
  seconds.

For an MIDI track:

- a channel indicator, the channel numbers lighting up as events come in
  to show channel activity.
- a MIDI monitor, showing the last four MIDI events.
