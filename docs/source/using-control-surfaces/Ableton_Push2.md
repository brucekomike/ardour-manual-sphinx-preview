# Using the Ableton Push 2
![The Ableton Push 2 surface](/images/push2-main.jpg)

Since version 5.4, Ardour has had extensive support for the Ableton
Push2. This is an expensive but beautifully engineered control surface
primarily targeting the workflow found in Ableton\'s Live software and
other similar tools such as Bitwig. As of version 5.4, Ardour does not
offer the same kind of workflow, so we have designed our support for the
Push 2 around mixing and editing and musical performance, without the
clip/scene oriented approach in Live. This may change in future versions
of Ardour.

## Connecting the Push 2

Plug the USB cable from the Push 2 into a USB2 or USB3 port on your
computer. For brighter backlighting, also plug in the power supply (this
is not necessary for use).

The Push 2 will be automatically recognized by your operating system,
and will appear in any of the lists of possible MIDI ports in both
Ardour and other similar software.

::: note
Linux does not provide normal users access to arbitrary USB devices by
default (this is a security measure). To give yourself access to the
Push2, you need to create a file in the `/etc/udev/rules.d` folder
(directory). The name of the should be something like
\"50-Ableton-Push2.rules\" (the only critical parts are that it ends in
\".rules\" and is unique). The file should contain the following single
line:

SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"2982\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"1967\",
MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"audio\"

Note that you will need to be member of the group named in the \"GROUP\"
property (\"audio\" in the example above).
:::

Normally, Ardour should be able to automatically detect a connected Push
2 device. If it fails, open the Preferences dialog, and then click on
\"Control Surfaces\". Click on the \"Enable\" button in the line that
says \"Ableton Push 2\" in order to activate Ardour\'s Push 2 support.

Once you select the input and output port, Ardour will initialize the
Push 2 and it will be ready to use. You only need do this once: once
these ports are connected and your session has been saved, the
connections will be made automatically in this and other future
sessions.

## Push 2 Configuration

The only configuration option at this time is whether the pads send
aftertouch or polyphonic pressure messages. You can alter this setting
via the Push 2 GUI, accessed by double-clicking on the \"Push 2\" entry
in the control surfaces list.

## Basic Concepts

With the Push 2 support in Ardour 5.4, you can do the following things:

  -------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perform using the 8 x 8 pad \"grid\"                     The Push 2 has really lovely pressure-sensitive pads that can also generate either aftertouch or note (polyphonic) pressure.
  Global Mixing                                            See many tracks at once, and control numerous parameters for each.
  Track/Bus Mixing                                         View a single track/bus, with even more parameters for the track.
  Choose the mode/scale, root note and more for the pads   37 scales are available. Like Live, Ardour offers both \"in-key\" and \"chromatic\" pad layouts.
  -------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

... plus a variety of tasks related to transport control, selection,
import, click track control and more.

## Musical Performance

Messages sent from the 8x8 pad grid and the \"pitch bend bar\" are
routed to a special MIDI port within Ardour called \"Push 2 Pads\" (no
extra latency is incurred from this routing). Although you can manually
connect this port to whatever you wish, the normal behaviour of
Ardour\'s Push 2 support is to connect the pads to the most recently
selected MIDI track.

This means that to play a soft-synth/instrument plugin in a given MIDI
track with the Push 2, you just need to select that track.

If multiple MIDI tracks are selected at once, the first selected track
will be used. Note that messages originating from all other controls on
the Push 2 will *not* not be delivered to the \"Push 2 Pads\" port. This
makes no difference in practice, because the other controls do not send
messages that are useful for musical performance.

## Global Mix

This is the default mode that Ardour will start the Push 2 in. In this
mode, the 8 knobs at the top of the device, the 8 buttons below them,
the video display and the 8 buttons below that are combined to provide a
global view of the session mix.

![Global mix mode on Push2 screen](/images/push2-globalmix.png)

The upper buttons are labelled by text in the video display just below
them. Pressing one of the buttons changes the function of the knobs, and
the parameters that will shown for each track/bus in the display.

As of Ardour 5.4, the possible parameters are:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Volumes                           | The display shows a knob and text |
|                                   | displaying the current gain       |
|                                   | setting for the track, and a      |
|                                   | meter that corresponds precisely  |
|                                   | to the meter shown in the Ardour  |
|                                   | GUI for that track. Changing the  |
|                                   | meter type (e.g. from Peak to     |
|                                   | K12) in the GUI will also change  |
|                                   | it in the Push 2 display. The     |
|                                   | physical knob will alter          |
|                                   | track/bus gain.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Pans                              | The display shows a knob          |
|                                   | indicating the pan                |
|                                   | direction/azimuth for the         |
|                                   | corresponding track/bus. Turning  |
|                                   | the physical knob will pan the    |
|                                   | track left and right. If the      |
|                                   | track/bus has no panner (i.e. it  |
|                                   | has only a single output), no     |
|                                   | knob is shown and the physical    |
|                                   | knob will do nothing.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Pan Widths                        | For tracks with 2 outputs, the    |
|                                   | display will show a knob          |
|                                   | indicating the pan width setting  |
|                                   | for the corresponding track/bus.  |
|                                   | The physical knob can be turned   |
|                                   | to adjust the width.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Unlike many DAWs, Ardour\'s       |
|                                   | stereo panners have \"width\"     |
|                                   | parameter that defaults to 100%.  |
|                                   | You cannot change the pan         |
|                                   | direction/azimuth of a track with |
|                                   | 100% width, but must first reduce |
|                                   | the width in order to pan it.     |
|                                   | Similarly, a track panned         |
|                                   | anywhere other than dead center   |
|                                   | has limits on the maximum width   |
|                                   | setting. If these concepts are    |
|                                   | not familiar to you, please be    |
|                                   | aware than many DAWs use a        |
|                                   | \"panner\" that actually          |
|                                   | implement \"balance\" and not     |
|                                   | \"panning\", hence the            |
|                                   | difference.                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| A Sends                           | The display shows a knob          |
|                                   | indicating the gain level for the |
|                                   | first send in that track. If the  |
|                                   | track has no send, no knob will   |
|                                   | be shown, and the physical knob   |
|                                   | for that track will do nothing.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| B Sends, C Sends, D Sends         | Like \"A Sends\", but for the     |
|                                   | 2nd, 3rd and 4th sends of a       |
|                                   | track/bus respectively.           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

To change which tracks are shown while in global mix mode, use the left
and right arrow/cursor keys just below and to the right of the display.
Tracks and busses that are hidden in Ardour\'s GUI will also be hidden
from display on the Push 2.

To select a track/bus directly from the Push 2, press the corresponding
button below the display. The track name will be highlighted, and the
selection will change in Ardour\'s GUI as well (and also any other
control surfaces).

### Soloing and Muting in Global Mix mode

The Solo and Mute buttons to the left of the video display can be used
to solo and mute tracks while in Global Mix mode. The operation will be
applied to the *first* currently selected track(s).

There are two indications that one or more tracks are soloed:

1.  The solo button will blink red
2.  Track names will be prefixed by \"\*\" if they are soloed, and \"-\"
    if they are muted due to soloing.

To cancel solo, either:

- Select the soloed track(s) and press the solo button again
- Press and hold the solo button for more than 1 second

## Track Mix

Track Mix mode allows you to focus on a single track in more detail than
is possible in Global Mix mode. To enter (or leave) Track Mix mode,
press the \"Mix\" button.

In Track Mix mode, various aspects of the state of the first selected
track/bus will be displayed on the Push 2. Above the display, the first
4 knobs control track volume (gain), pan directiom/azimuth, pan width,
and where appropriate, track input trim.

Below the display, 7 buttons provide immediate control of mute, solo,
rec-enable, monitoring (input or disk or automatic), solo isolate and
solo safe state. When a a track is muted due to other track(s) soloing,
the mute button will flash (to differentiate from its state when it is
explicitly muted).

The video display also shows meters for the track, which as in Global
Mix mode, precisely match the meter type shown in Ardour\'s GUI. There
are also two time displays showing the current playhead position in both
musical (beats\|bars\|ticks) format, and as hours:minutes:seconds.

To change which track is visible in Track Mix mode, use the left/right
arrow/cursor keys just below and to the right of the video display.

## Scale Selection

Press the Scale button to enter Scale mode. The display will look like
this:

![Track mix mode on Push2 screen](/images/push2-scale.png)

In the center, 37 scales are presented. Scroll through them by either
using the cursor/arrow keys to the lower right of the display, or the
knobs above the display. The scale will change dynamically as you
scroll. You can also scroll in whole pages using the upper right and
upper left buttons above the display (they will display \"\<\" and
\"\>\" if scrolling is possible).

To change the root note of the scale, press the corresponding button
above or below the video display.The button will be lit to indicate your
selection (and the text will be highlighted).

By default, Ardour configures the Push 2 pads to use \"in-key\" mode,
where all pads correspond to notes \"in\" the chosen scale. Notes
corresponding to the root note, or the equivalent note in higher
octaves, are highlighted with the color of the current target MIDI
track.

In \"chromatic\" mode, the pads correspond to a continuous sequence of
notes starting with your selected root note. Pads corresponding to notes
in the scale are illuminated; those corresponding to the root note are
lit with the color the current target MIDI track. Other pads are left
dark, but you can still play them.

To switch between them, press button on the lower left of the video
display; the text above it will display the current mode (though it is
usually visually self-evident from the pad lighting pattern).

To leave Scale mode, press the \"Scale\" button again. You may also use
the upper left button above the display, though if you have scrolled
left, it may require more than one press.

## Specific Button/Knob Functions

In addition to the layouts described above, many (but not all) of the
buttons and knobs around the edges of the Push 2 will carry out various
functions related to their (illuminated) label. As of Ardour 5.4, this
includes:

  -------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Metronome (button and adjacent knob)   Enables/disables the click (metronome). The knob directly above it will control the volume (gain) of the click.
  Undo/Redo                              Undo or redo the previous editing operation.
  Delete                                 Deletes the currently selected region, or range, or note. Equivalent to using Ctrl/Cmd-x on the keyboard.
  Quantize                               If a MIDI region is selected in Ardour, this will open the quantize dialog.
  Duplicate                              Duplicates the current region or range selection.
  Rec-Enable                             Enables and disables Ardour\'s global record enable state.
  Play                                   Starts and stops the transport. Press Shift-Play to return to the session start.
  Add Track                              Opens Ardour\'s Add Track/Bus dialog.
  Browse                                 Open\'s Ardour\'s import dialog to select and audition existing audio and MIDI files.
  Master                                 Pressing this button jumps directly to Track Mix mode, with the master out bus displayed.
  Cursor arrows                          These are used by some modes to navigate within the display (e.g Scale mode). In other modes, the up/down cursor arrows will scroll the GUI display up and down, while the left/right cursor arrows will generally scroll within the Push 2 display itself.
  Repeat                                 Enables/disables loop playback. This will follow Ardour\'s \"loop is mode\" preference, just like the loop button in the Ardour GUI.
  Octave buttons                         These shift the root note of the current pad scale up or down by 1 octave.
  Page buttons                           These scroll Ardour\'s editor display left and right along the timeline.
  Master (top right) knob                This knob controls the gain/volume of Ardour\'s main output. If the session has a monitor section.
  -------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
