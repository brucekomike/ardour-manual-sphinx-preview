# Using the PreSonus FaderPort
Ardour has full support for the Presonus Faderport controller. This is a
compact control surface featuring a single motorized fader, a single
knob (encoder) and 24 buttons with fixed labels. It is a relatively
low-cost device that functions very well to control a single (selected)
track or bus, along with a variety of other \"global\" settings and
conditions.

## Connecting the Faderport

The Faderport comes with a single USB socket on the back. Connect a
suitable USB cable from there to a USB port on your computer. As of the
end of 2015, you should avoid USB3 ports---these cause erratic behaviour
with the device. This issue might get fixed by Presonus in the future.

Ardour uses the Faderport in what Presonus calls \"native\" mode. You do
not need to do anything to enable this---Ardour will set the device to
be in the correct mode. In native mode, the Faderport sends and receives
ordinary MIDI messages to/from the host, and the host understands the
intended meaning of these messages. We note this detail to avoid
speculation about whether Ardour supports the device via the HUI
protocol---it does not.

The Faderport will be automatically recognized by your operating system,
and will appear in any of the lists of possible MIDI ports in both
Ardour and other similar software.

To connect the Faderport to Ardour, open the Preferences dialog, and
then click on \"Control Surfaces\". Click on the \"Enable\" button in
the line that says \"Faderport\" in order to activate Ardour\'s
Faderport support. Then double click on the line that says
\"Faderport\". A new dialog will open, containing (among other things)
two dropdown selectors that will allow you to identify the MIDI ports
where your Faderport is connected.

Once you select the input and output port, Ardour will initialize the
Faderport and it will be ready to use. You only need do this once: once
these ports are connected and your session has been saved, the
connections will be made automatically in this and other future
sessions.

You do not need to use the power supply that comes with the Faderport
but without it, the fader will not be motorized. This makes the overall
experience of using the Faderport much less satisfactory, since the
fader will not move when Ardour tells it to, leading to very out-of-sync
conditions between the physical fader position and the \"fader
position\" inside the program.

## Using the Faderport

The Faderport\'s controls can be divided into three groups:

1.  Global controls such as the transport buttons
2.  Controls which change the settings for particular track or bus
3.  Controls which alter which track or bus is modified by the
    per-track/bus controls.

Because the Faderport has only a single set of per-track controls, by
default those controls operate on the first selected track or bus. If
there is no selected track or bus, the controls will do nothing.

### Transport Buttons

The transport buttons all work as you would expect.

| Rewind                            | When pressed on its own, starts   |
|                                   | the transport moving backwards.   |
|                                   | Successive presses speed up the   |

|                                   | up the \"fast forward\"           |
|                                   | behaviour.                        |

### Other Global Controls

The [Mix]{.kbd .button}, [Proj]{.kbd .button}, [Trns]{.kbd .button}
buttons do not obviously correspond to any particular functions or
operations in Ardour. We have therefore allowed users to choose from a
carefully curated set of possible actions that seem related to the
button labels in some clear way. This can be done via the Faderport
configuration dialog accessed via `Preferences > Control Surfaces`. Each
button has 3 possible actions associated with it:

- Plain Press: action to be taken when the button is pressed on its own.
- Shift-Press: action to be taken when the button is pressed in
  conjunction with the Shift button.
- Long Press: action to be taken when the button is pressed on its own
  and held down for more than 0.5 seconds.

Click on the relevant drop-down selector to pick an action as you
prefer.

The User button also has no obvious mapping to specific Ardour
functionality, so we allow users to choose from *any* possible GUI
action. The menu for selecting the action is somewhat confusing and it
can be hard to find what you\'re looking for. However, all possible
actions are there, so keep looking!

### Track Selection Controls

You can manually change the track/bus controlled by the Faderport by
changing the selected track in Ardour\'s editor window. If you select
more than 1 track, the Faderport will control the first selected track
and *only* that track/bus.

```{eval-rst}

| Left (arrow)                      | This causes the Ardour GUI to     |
|                                   | select the previous track/bus     |
|                                   | (using the current visual order   |
|                                   | in the editor window), which will |
|                                   | in turn cause the Faderport to    |
|                                   | control that track. If there is   |
|                                   | no previous track/bus, the        |
|                                   | selected track/bus is left        |
|                                   | unchanged, and the Faderport      |
|                                   | continues to control it.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

|                                   | select the next track/bus (using  |

|                                   | Faderport in the same way that    |
|                                   | Output assigns the Master bus.    |
|                                   | This is also a toggle setting, so |

|                                   | controlling whichever track/bus   |
|                                   | was selected before.              |

|                                   | If you press Shift-Output after a |
|                                   | single press to Output (i.e.      |
|                                   | control the Monitor Section while |
|                                   | currently controlling the Master  |
|                                   | bus) or vice versa (i.e. control  |
