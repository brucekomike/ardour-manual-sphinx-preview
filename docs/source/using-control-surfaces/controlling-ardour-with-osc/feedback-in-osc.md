# Feedback
Feedback from the Ardour to the the control surface is very useful for a
number of things. Motor faders need to know where the the track they
have been attached to is at before they were assigned otherwise the DAW
fader will jump to where the controller fader is. Likewise, the buttons
on each strip need to know what their value is so they can light their
LED correctly. Transport controls should let you know if they are active
too. This is what feedback is all about.

Ardour does feedback by sending the same path back that is used to
control the same function. As such any controls that have feedback have
a parameter that is the value of the control or its state (on or off).
In the case of OSC paths listed on the main OSC page as having no
parameter, if they have feedback, they will also work with a 1 for
button press and 0 for button release. This is because many OSC
controllers will only use exactly the same path for feedback as for
control. For example:

  ------------------------------ --
  [/transport_stop]{.kbd .osc}   
  ------------------------------ --

can be used also in the form:

  -------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [/transport_stop *press*]{.kbd .osc}   where *press* is an int/bool indicating if the button is pressed or not.
  -------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The feedback does not have the same meaning as the control message.
Where the button release sent to Ardour will be ignored and has no
meaning. Both states have meaning in feedback to the controller. The
feedback will be:

  -------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [/transport_stop *state*]{.kbd .osc}   where *state* is an int/bool indicating if the transport is stopped or not.
  -------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

With feedback turned on, OSC control commands that try to change a
control that does not exist will get feedback that resets that control
to off. For example, sending a /strip/recenable to a buss will not work
and Ardour will try to turn the controller LED off in that case. Also
note that Pan operation may be limited by pan width in some cases. That
is with pan width at 100% (or -100%) there is no pan position movement
available.

It may come as a surprise, but feedback often generates more network
traffic than control itself does. Some things are more obvious like head
position or meters. But even a simple button push like transport start
sends not only a signal to turn on the play LED, but also one to turn
off the stop LED, the Rewind LED, the Fast Forward LED and the Loop LED.
That is still minor, think instead of a surface refresh such as happens
when the surface is first connected and then most of that happens every
time the fader strips are banked. This is why feedback is enabled in
sections so that as little feedback as is actually needed is sent. This
is also a consideration if the surface is connected via wifi.

## List of OSC feedback messages

### Feedback only

These messages are feedback only. They are sent as status from Ardour
and some of them may be enabled separately from other feedback. See:
[Calculating Feedback and Strip-types
Values.](@@osc58-feedback-and-strip-types-values#feedback)

See strip section below for info about ssid and wrapping it into the
path. Also /master and /monitor support what the /strip does.

In the case where Gainmode is set to position, the track name will show
the dB value while values are changing.

### Master and monitor strips

Master and monitor strips are similar to track strips but do not use the
SSID. Rather they use their name as part of the path:

  ----------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Track specific operations

For each of the following, *ssid* is the surface strip ID for the track

Some Surfaces (many Android applets) are not able to deal with more than
one parameter in a command. However, the two parameter commands below
can also be sent as /strip/command/ssid param. Feedback can be set to
match this with the /set_surface/feedback *state* command. See

### Selected Operations

Selection feedback is the same as for strips, only the path changes from

  ------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Selected Plugin

Feedback about plugin parameters is sent only for a single, selected
plugin (parameters for other plugins and other strips can be changed
with [/select/plugin/parameter]{.kbd .osc} and
[/strip/plugin/parameter]{.kbd .osc}, but without feedback). Whenever
the plugin (or strip) changes, the name and activation of the plugin and
name and value of a number of its parameters (determined by the plugin
page size) is sent as feedback.

  ---------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [/select/plugin/name *name*]{.kbd .osc}                    where *name* is a string with the name of the selected plugin
  [/select/plugin/parameter/name *paid* *name*]{.kbd .osc}   where *name* is a string with the name of the specified parameter.
  [/select/plugin/parameter *paid* *value*]{.kbd .osc}       where *value* is a float ranging from 0 to 1 representing the current parameter value.
  ---------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Menu actions

There is no feedback for Menu actions.

Every single menu item in Ardour\'s GUI is accessible via OSC. However,
there is no provision for returning the state of anything set this way.
This is not a bad thing as most menu items either do not have an on/off
state or that state is quite visible. Bindings that affect other
parameters that OSC does track will show on those OSC controls. Examples
of this might be track record enable for tracks 1 to 32, play or stop.
