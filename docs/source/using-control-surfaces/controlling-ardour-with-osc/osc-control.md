# Basics
[[OSC]{.dfn}]{.abbr title="Open Sound Control"} lets synthesizers and
other devices communicate with Ardour. OSC devices can send commands
relating to playback (such as play or stop), performance (such as
volume, play, stop), and almost any other function (such as Edit, or
Undo).

*Note:* OSC control has changed dramatically since Ardour 4.7. The Path
structure has been completely redone, Banking has been introduced, The
controller is now able to tell Ardour what kind of feedback it can work
with (including bank size) and the gain controls have new math
calculations.

Ardour is probably one of the most OSC-controllable audio applications
around, but as with all OSC-controllable apps, you can\'t do much
without knowing what [messages]{.dfn} can be sent. This document
describes the various categories of messages that Ardour understands. It
is subject to change, particularly the \"Actions\" part below, since
this relates to the GTK GUI for Ardour rather than the backend.

## Connecting to Ardour via OSC

OSC support is not enabled by default, but can be turned on via [Edit \>
Preferences \> Control Surfaces]{.kbd .menu}. Once enabled, Ardour will
listen on port `3819` by default. This port number can be changed by
editing `$ARDOUR_CONFIG` and adding this line within the `<Config>`
section:

[\<Option name=\"osc-port\" value=\"*Your choice here*\"/\>]{.kbd
.input}

Ardour sends any feedback to the port and address that sent any feedback
request or to a port set manually in the setup dialog. The port does not
have to match Ardour\'s port. In fact it is better not to. This means
that Ardour can deal with more than one controller at a time. The two
controllers can bank independently and even use different math for
faders. This could be used to allow talent to adjust their own monitor
mix using a tablet or phone that can run an OSC controller. For a full
explanation of how Ardour\'s feedback works please read [OSC feedback In
Ardour.](@@osc58-feedback)

## Control Surface Set Up {#osc_set-up}

Control surface set up allows the controller to tell Ardour about its
capabilities. The surface can tell Ardour how many control strips it has
for banking, if it is capable of setting its faders or buttons to values
set by Ardour\'s GUI or automation, What kind of math the faders use and
more.

Any time the */set_surface* command is sent, the current bank is
recalculated and if feedback is turned on, the values of each strip\'s
controls are sent (or refreshed) as well. This will also refresh the
Master feedback setup.

As of Ardour 5.1, There is now a GUI setup in response to those using
tablets with applications such as touchOSC or AndrOSC who need to be
able to set a port for Ardour to send to. It can also change the default
setting for set_surface. For more information about Ardour\'s OSC
configuration GUI please read [Ardour\'s Setup
Dialog.](@@osc58-using-the-setup-dialog)

If /set_surface is not sent, the default values are used:

- *Bank Size*: 0 --- No banking (or infinite bank size).
- *Strip Types*: 159 --- All strip types except hidden and special.
- *Feedback*: 0 --- All off.
- *Fader Mode*: 0 --- gain in dB (not relevant with feedback off)
- *Send Page Size*: 0 --- No Send Paging.
- *Plugin Page Size*: 0 --- No Plugin (parameter) Paging.
- *reply port*: 8000 --- control surface will receive feedback on port
  8000
- *Link set*: 0 --- no linking for this control surface
- *Link ID*: 0 --- no link ID

These values give the same behaviour as prior versions of Ardour. (or
the closest possible)

[/set_surface *bank_size* *strip_types* *feedback* *fadermode*
*send_page_size* *plugin_page_size* *port* *linkset* *linkid*]{.kbd
.osc}

See below for an explanation of each parameter.

The /set_surface message may have all values except the last in-line.
For example: `/set_surface/8/31/8403/0/8 i 16` would be valid. Do be
careful of switches which send a 0 on release, it may be necessary to
set the value as the release value rather than the press value.

The /set_surface message may have less than the full set of parameters.
those left out will remain as they were before the /set_surface message
was sent. All parameters included must be valid. For example, setting
send page size would require also setting bank_size, strip_types,
feedback and gain mode. using only two parameters will set bank_size and
strip_types. Sending /set_surface with no parameters will result in
Ardour returning a /set_surface message with the current settings.
Surfaces using /set_surface iiii b st fb gm as was the case in versions
of Ardour older than 5.10 will continue to work.

### bank_size

Bank Size is the number of channel strips the controller supports
without banking. Setting this to 0 turns banking off by setting the bank
size to infinite.

Bank size can also be set with */set_surface/bank_size size.*

### strip_types

strip_types is an integer made up of bits. The easy way to deal with
this is to think of strip_types items being worth a number and then
adding all those numbers together for a value to send. Strip Types will
determine what kind of strips will be included in bank. This would
include: Audio, MIDI, busses, VCAs, Master, Monitor and hidden or
selected strips.

Aside from setting the track types for the main mix assignments, using
/set_surface/strip_types with more than one surface button will allow
switching between modes for example: inputs only, busses only, selected
only, hidden only, by having the buttons send values of: 3, 12, 256,
512. A full mix button might have a value 31.

While Master and Monitor are listed as possibilities, most surfaces will
not use them. Using /master and /monitor makes more sense. However, in
the case where there are no master or monitor fader strips on the
surface, it may be necessary to include them in the banked strips.

Please see: [Calculating Feedback and Strip-types
Values.](@@osc58-feedback-and-strip-types-values)

Strip types can also be set with */set_surface/strip_types types.*

### feedback

Feedback is an integer made up of bits. The easy way to deal with this
is to think of feedback items being worth a number and then adding all
those numbers together for a value to send.

Please see: [Calculating Feedback and Strip-types
Values.](@@osc58-feedback-and-strip-types-values#feedback)

Feedback can also be set with */set_surface/feedback feedback.*

### gainmode

Gainmode is an int:

- *0:* dB value as a float from -193 to +6. Sent as [/strip/gain SSID
  value]{.kbd .osc}. (-193 or below are the same as −∞)
- *1:* A positional fader based on the same math as Ardour\'s GUI. A
  Float from 0 to 1. Sent as [/strip/fader SSID value]{.kbd .osc}. At
  the same time the gain value in dB is sent to the channel name as
  text. The name will be restored after a short timeout.
- *2:* A positional fader based on the same math as Ardour\'s GUI. A
  Float from 0 to 1. Sent as [/strip/fader SSID value]{.kbd .osc}. At
  the same time the gain value in dB is sent as [/strip/gain SSID
  value]{.kbd .osc}.
- *3:* A positional fader based on the same math as Ardour\'s GUI. A
  Float from 0 to 1. Sent as [/strip/fader SSID value]{.kbd .osc}.

Gainmode applies only to feedback values. The controller can choose
which gain math to use by choosing to use the /\*/gain or /\*/fader path
to send to Ardour. This makes sure a controller that doesn\'t set up
Ardour\'s OSC can still use either math. The gainmode for feedback also
determines the path Ardour uses for feedback so that the feedback
messages match the control messages.

Gain mode can also be set with */set_surface/gainmode gainmode.*

### send_page_size

Send_page_size is an int for the number of send channels that can be
controlled at one time. Each channel has a name, level and enable
control. (added in Ardour 5.10)

Send page size can also be set with */set_surface/send_page_size
send_page_size.*

### plugin_page_size

plugin_page_size is an int for the number of plugin controls that can be
controlled at one time. Each control has a name and level. As each
plugin is different (as is each parameter), the surface should expect to
control the plugin parameters with a variable control (pot or slider)
with a float value from 0 to 1 (even on/off switches). (added in Ardour
5.10)

Plugin page size can also be set with */set_surface/plugin_page_size
plugin_page_size.*

### port

The port the controller would like to receive it\'s feedback on.
Starting with Ardour 6.0, the surface can directly set the manual port
or set it\'s host to `auto` port mode.

The value for `port` can be 0 for `auto` port mode or any port value
above 1024. It is suggested not to use Ardour\'s port number of 3819 as
controllers on the same machine that try to use the same port will fail.

If the surface does not tell Ardour which port to use, the default is
8000 or the setting set up in the OSC setup GUI. There can only be one
port setting per host. If that setting is `auto`, than more than one
controller can be run on that host, but if a manual port is set there
can only be one. In the case of `auto` mode, the control surface must
set it\'s receive port to be the same as it\'s send port. If that is not
possible, then manual port mode must be used. This allows a smart
controller to use a number of ports on the same ip while a smartphone
set up as a personal monitor control can use the default manual port.

The host\'s port can also be set with */set_surface/port port.*

Changing the port will remove feedback from a device on the same host
using a different port.

### Link set and Link ID

Please see [Linking Surfaces](@@osc58-linking-surfaces) For more
information.

## Querying Ardour for information

The control Surface may wish to control the type a frequency of updates
it receives. It can do this with querying commands. See: [Querying
Ardour with OSC.](@@osc58-querying-ardour)

## Using more than one surface

Ardour can use more than one surface at a time that both control the
same controls in Ardour. It is also possible to use two surfaces in
concert with each other. See: [Linking
Surfaces](@@osc58-linking-surfaces) for more information.

## List of OSC messages

Parameter types show how the value will be used. However, they may be
sent as a different type if needed, see: [Parameter Types in
OSC.](@@osc58-parameter-types)

This list shows all messages that can be sent to Ardour to control it.
Most of these messages are also sent back as feedback when the
corresponding value changes. There exist additional feedback-only
messages, see: [Feedback](@@osc58-feedback) for more information.

### Track specific operations {#osc_strips}

For each of the following, *ssid* is the Surface Strip ID for the track

As of Ardour 6.0, the user may use a subset all available strips. See:
[Making a user selected strip list.](@@osc58-custom-strips)

SSID has a different meaning than RID in Ardour version 4.7 and before.
Effectively, banking is always being used and the SSID is generated on
the fly. The SSID is the position of the strip within bank as an int 1
to bank size. There are no gaps as there have been in the past.
Depending on the value of strip_types sent to Ardour, Master and
Monitor, may be included in the list of SSIDs or not as set in
*/set_surface*.

Some Surfaces (many Android applets) are not able to deal with more than
one parameter in a command. However, the two parameter commands below
can also be sent as /strip/command/ssid param. In this case the param
should be a float even if an int is required below.

### Selected Strip Operations {#osc_select}

New for Ardour 5, A whole set of operations that work on the selected or
expanded strip.

Selected strip operations are complex enough for their own page. Please
read: [Selection Considerations in
OSC.](@@osc58-selection-and-expansion-considerations) This is most
important if more than one OSC surface is being used with Ardour.

There are two kinds of selection in OSC. GUI selection and local
expansion. By default expansion follows selection.

- GUI selection: Use */strip/select* to set. Selecting a strip in the
  GUI will set OSC surface select and the surface will set GUI selection
  as well.
- Local expansion: Use */strip/expand* to expand a strip without
  changing overall selection. When /strip/expand is set to 0 or false,
  the select channel will go back to using the strip selected by the
  GUI. While expand is turned on, selecting a strip on the GUI does not
  select the OSC strip. Sending a /strip/select message will override
  the expand as if it had been set to false. Good for more than one OSC
  controller at a time.

|----|----|
| [/strip/select *ssid* *y/n*]{.kbd .osc} | Where *y/n* = 1 for select. Sets both GUI select and strip to expanded mode. (0 is ignored) |

and a switch with a value of `-1` for page down. An encoder can be used
as well. (these commands were added in Ardour version 5.10)

### Selected Plugin Operations {#osc_plugins}

These operations control the selected plugin on the selected strip.
Plugins and parameters are specified by their position in the list of
plugins and controllable parameters. Parameters are paged to allow
accessing all parameters on a surface with limited inputs, the plugin
(parameter) page size is configured with [/set_surface]{.kbd .osc}.

When the selected strip is changed, the plugin in the same position in
the newly selected strip is made the selected plugin (even if it is a
different type of plugin). If the new strip has fewer plugins, the last
plugin is selected. If the new strip has no plugins, no plugin is
selected.

```

The *paid* argument is specified as a 1-based index into the list of
*controllable* parameters only (as specified by the controllable flag in
the [[/strip/plugin/descriptor]{.kbd .osc} query
message](@@osc58-querying-ardour), skipping non-controllable-only
parameters).

#### Using groups with strip and select (new for Ardour 6.0) {#osc_groups}

No grouping will occur unless `use_group` is set either by using
[/set_surface/strip_types]{.kbd .osc} with the use groups bit set or by
using [/use_group i 1]{.kbd .osc}.

The result for [/strip/group]{.kbd .osc} or [/select/group]{.kbd .osc}
is determined by the parameter passed in the command and the current
group and available list of groups. The group name the control surface
sends may be:

- \"none\", \"\" or \" \" will remove this strip from this group. If
  this was the only strip in this group, the group is deleted. Some OSC
  controllers have trouble sending an empty string and a list of groups
  contains \"none\" as well so a dropdown can just send a text item and
  work.
- The name of a group this strip does not belong to will remove this
  strip from it\'s current group and add it to the named group. If this
  strip was the only strip in the group it was removed from, that group
  will be deleted.
- An unused name when this strip is not part of a group will create a
  new group with the group name sent and add this strip to that group
- An unused name when this strip is already a part of a group will
  rename this group to the name sent.

To create a new group from a strip that is already joined to a group,
the strip must first remove itself from the current group.

#### Spill Strips {#osc_spill}

[/select/spill]{.kbd .osc} or [/strip/spill]{.kbd .osc} will:

- set the current set of strips in use to include only the strips that
  are a part of the group the strip is a part of so long as that strip
  is a track.
- set the current set of strips to the set of strips that feed this
  strip if it is a bus. In the case where this strip is being fed by
  sends rather than strip outputs, the strips that feed this bus will
  have their names set to the name of the strip with *-send* appended to
  it and the fader, pan and mute will control the send rather than the
  strip. The other strip controls will be disabled in this mode. This
  only happens when the strip that calls spill is a bus. In the case
  where a strip that is part of a group is chosen as above where the
  group all sends to a common bus this will not happen. This can be
  useful for a group that uses \"Add New Aux Bus\" to switch from sends
  to faders.
- set the current set of strips to the set of strips that are controlled
  by the VCA if this strip is a VCA.

spill/group, spill/bus or spill/vca can also be used to force the type
of spilling that is done. This may be useful if the strip is a bus that
is a part of a group and the group variation is required.

In all cases, if there is a bus or VCA attached to the group of strips
it will be included as well.

What is less obvious, is how to return to the normal set of strips.
There are a number of ways of doing so depending on the operator\'s
wishes. The most obvious way is to use [/set_surface/strip_types]{.kbd
.osc} to set the strip list as desired. It is expected that a control
surface may have more than one strip types button in any case to see
only inputs or only busses etc and of course one to give a full mix.
Another option is to reselect the custom set of strips with
[/strip/custom/mode *mode*]{.kbd .osc}.

#### Controlling plugins {#osc_plugins_details}

### Menu actions {#osc_menu}

Every single menu item in Ardour\'s GUI is accessible via OSC. There is
a single common syntax to trigger the action as if it was selected with
the mouse (or keyboard):

[/access_action *action_name*]{.kbd .osc}

As of Ardour 5.9, *access_action* can be inlined for control surfaces
that are unable to send string parameters. The *action_name* is composed
of a group and an action in the form of *Group/action* which fits very
well as an OSC path extension:

[/access_action/*Group/action* *key_pressed*]{.kbd .osc}

The key_pressed is optional, but if present is a float 1 or 0 where the
command is ignored if key_pressed is 0.

Some of the Menu Actions duplicate other OSC commands. In all cases it
is better to use the OSC commands rather than the Menu Actions if
possible as the OSC commands are more direct.

The [list of actions](@@list-of-menu-actions) shows all available values
of *action-name* for Ardour.
