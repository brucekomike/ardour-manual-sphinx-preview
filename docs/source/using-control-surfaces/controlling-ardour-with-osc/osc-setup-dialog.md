# Using the setup dialog
Starting with Ardour 5.1 OSC has a graphic setup dialog. This dialog can
be accessed from Preferences-\>Control Surfaces. Select OSC and click on
the Show Protocol Settings.

The Ardour OSC dialog has three tabs. The main tab, the Strip Types tab
and the Feedback tab.

Many OSC devices get their IP from a DHCP making it difficult to set an
IP in Ardour\'s OSC settings. Therefore, most of the settings are
*default* settings. Values are set and the next OSC surface to send an
OSC message to Ardour will use those settings. Any change to a setting
will reset all device settings. The use of */set_surface* will override
all settings except *Port Mode*. *Port Mode* affects all connected
surfaces and so all surfaces must use either the set manual port or send
OSC messages from the same port they expect to receive feedback on.

## Dialog settings

### OSC setup tab

![The OSC configuration dialog](/images/osc-dialog.png)

#### Connection:

This field is informational only. It shows where Ardour will receive OSC
messages. The system Name and the Port are the most important parts.
Normally, Ardour will use 3819 as its server port. However, if some
other server is already using this port, Ardour will try to use the next
port up and will keep trying up to 10 ports up.

#### Port Mode:

![Port Mode Dropdown](/images/osc-portmode.png)

This drop down allows the choice of Auto or Manual outbound port
setting. The Auto port mode, will send OSC messages back to the port
messages from that surface are received from. This setting allows two
surfaces on the same IP to operate independently. However, there are a
number of OSC control surfaces that do not monitor the same port they
send from and in fact may change ports they send from as well. Manual
allows the outgoing port, the port the surface will receive on, to be
manually set. In Manual port mode only one control surface per IP can
work. Most phone or tablet OSC controllers like touchOSC or Control need
Manual port mode. More than one controller can be used so long as each
has it\'s own IP.

#### Manual Port:

This is an Entry box for setting the outgoing port when in Manual port
mode.

#### Bank Size:

This sets the default bank size for the next surface to send a
*/set_surface/\** OSC message. Bank size 0 (the default) sets no banking
and allows controlling all strips included in strip_types at once. The
entry area will be bright blue for a port that is not valid (ports below
1024 or 3819).

#### Send Page Size:

This allows setting the size of pages for sends. In the case there are
more sends than controls. A size of 0 is the same as no paging and all
sends are directly controllable.

#### Plugin Page Size:

This allows setting the size of pages for plugin controls. Some plugins
have hundreds of controls and so it may be necessary to page the plugin
controls to a limited number of physical controls. A size of 0 is the
same as no paging and all plugin controls are directly controllable.

#### Gain Mode:

![Gain Mode Dropdown](/images/osc-gainmode.png)

Sets the faders (and sends faders) feedback math to position where a
value between 0 and 1 represents the fader position of the same fader in
the mixer GUI or dB where the feedback from fader movement will be
returned as a dB value. When the Gain Mode is set to position, there are
also options to send the gain in dB either to the channel name, /\*/name
feedback for the channel will show dB values in text while the fader is
being adjusted and then return the name text. It can also be set to send
both position and gain or just position.

#### Debug:

![Debug Mode Dropdown](/images/osc-debug.png)

For debugging purposes this allows logging either all OSC messages
Ardour receives or invalid messages received or none. The last option:
[Print surface information to Log window]{.kbd .menu} prints the
internal information that Ardour uses to create feedback for all
surfaces Ardour knows about.

#### Preset:

![Preset Loader](/images/osc-preset.png)

Ardour now allows the use of preset settings. The default settings used
are the settings from the last session or the factory defaults the first
time OSC is enabled. As soon as any of these settings are changed, the
Preset will change to \"User\" and the new settings will be save to the
osc directory in the [Ardour configuration
directory](@@files-and-directories-ardour-knows-about) as *user.preset*.
This preset file can be renamed for future use. It is suggested to also
change the name value inside to avoid confusion in the preset listing.
Ardour will ship with some of it\'s own presets that go with some
popular OSC control and map combinations.

#### Clear OSC Devices

This button has been removed after Ardour 5.10. Instead this action is
triggered by any change in the settings.

This button clears operating device profiles so that Ardour will reset
all devices settings to use the new defaults from changed settings. a
device may still override these new settings with the /set_surface set
of commands. The reason for setting defaults settings is that some OSC
controllers are not able to send more than one parameter at a time and
so having correct defaults allows one \"Connect\" button rather than 4.

### Default Strip Types tab

![The Default Strip Types tab](/images/osc-strip-types.png)

This allows selecting which of Ardour\'s mixer strips will be available
for control. The Factory default is all strips except master, monitor
and hidden strips. If it is desired to only see input tracks the others
can be deselected. It is also possible to change these settings from the
control surface. A set of buttons could select showing only inputs or
only busses. If a group is selected in the GUI then showing only
selected strips will show only that group. Showing hidden tracks is
handy for cases where a groups of tracks that grouped to a bus or
controlled by a VCA are hidden, but one of those tracks needs a tweak.

### Default Feedback tab

![The Default Feedback tab](/images/osc-feedbackdefault.png)

This allows setting up which controls provide feedback. The Factory
default is none. If the controller is unable to receive feedback, this
should be left blank. In the case of metering, Metering as a LED strip
only works if Metering as a Float is disabled.
