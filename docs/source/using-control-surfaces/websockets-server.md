# Using the WebSockets Server
The WebSockets Server is an experimental control surface that allows
controlling a running Ardour session via a web browser on any computer
in the same local network.

The connection between the WebSockets server and a running instance of
Ardour is two-way: any changes made in the web-based surface are
immediately available in Ardour, and vice versa.

The experimental status means that this control surface is not
feature-complete and might have bugs.

Supported features are currently limited to:

- Adjusting positions of channel faders and panners in tracks and the
  master bus, as well as muting and unmuting tracks.
- Changing settings of LV2 plugins that have already been loaded into
  tracks or the master bus.
- Rolling or pausing transport.

## Enabling and Accessing the WebSockets Server

To enable the WebSockets Server surface, open the *Preferences* dialog
and go to the *Control Surfaces* page. Click on the *Web Sockets Server
(Experimental)* to enable it. This will immediately run the server and
make it available on port 3818. You can verify that it\'s running by
opening a web browser on the same computer and visiting
<http://localhost:3818/>. You should see the home page that looks like
this:

To access the server from any device in the same network you need to
know the broadcast IP address or the hostname of the computer running
Ardour. To do that, open [Window \> Log]{.kbd .menu} right after
enabling the control surface and look at the message that says something
like this:

` 2025-02-28T21:42:14 [INFO]: ArdourWebsockets: listening on: http://fedora:3818/ `

Alternatively, you can use system\'s specific tools to discover the IP
address. Once you know the address or the hostname, you can open the
control surface web app in a browser by visiting the IP address with
appended port number. E.g. if the IP address of the computer running
Ardour is `192.168.1.68`, the entire URL will be
`http://192.168.1.68:3818/`.

## Using the WebSockets Server control surface

Various features available in the control surface are spread across
three pages: *Mixer*, *Transport*, and *Protocol*.

### Mixer

This is where you can view VU meters for each track and the master bus,
as well as make a number of adjustments:

- Change positions of faders and panners.
- Enable and disable the *Mute* status.
- Adjust settings of LV2 plugins loaded into mixer channels.

The control surface only supports changing settings for LV2 plugins
presently. LADSPA, VST2/VST3, and AU plugins will not be listed. When an
LV2 plugin has been loaded into a mixer channel, a button with \"f\"
caption appears on top of the mixer channel. Clicking it opens this kind
of an overlay:

### Transport

The *Transport* view displays the timecode of the current playhead
position and allows toggling playback.

The *Record* toggle is currently non-functional.

### Protocol

This page is targeted at developers willing to enhance the WebSockets
Server control surface. It displays the data passed between Ardour and
the web browser.
