# CD Track Markers
[CD Markers]{.dfn} are helpful for producing Cue sheets and TOC files
that describe how tracks are laid out on a CD Audio media and how these
tracks are named. These markers are displayed on the Location Markers
ruler.

## Creating CD Markers

Ardour supports two types of CD markers: single and paired. Each one of
them works best in a particular scenario (more on that below).

There are several ways to create a single CD marker:

- [Right]{.kbd .mouse}-clicking on the Location Markers ruler and
  selecting [Add \> CD Track Marker]{.kbd .menu}.
- Any pre-existing location marker can be converted to a CD marker. Thus
  clicking the [New Marker]{.kbd} button at the bottom of the [Ranges &
  Marks]{.kbd .window} sidebar, then enabling the [CD]{.kbd .option}
  checkbox for the newly created marker will effectively create a new CD
  marker.

There are also several ways to create paired CD markers:

- [Left]{.kbd .mouse .mod1}-clicking and dragging on the CD Markers
  ruler will render a red-filled preview area that encompasses the
  future CD marker range. Releasing the mouse button will create a pair
  of CD markers named \'CD*N*\' where N is a number that starts at 1 and
  is incremented by 1 (e.g. CD2, CD3 etc.) for every next pair of CD
  marker ranges.
- Creating a new pair of [range markers](@@creating-range-markers) in
  any supported way, then enabling the [CD]{.kbd .option} checkbox for
  the newly created range markers.

## Choosing Between Single and Paired Markers {#single-vs-paired-markers}

Single and paired CD markers both target dedicated use cases, which has
a lot to do with how tracks are laid in the Ardour session and how cue
sheets work.

Single markers work best when each song starts immediately after the
previous one. In that case the cue sheet will only reference the
beginning of each song (the \'INDEX 01\' section), and the TOC file will
contain ranges that last from the beginning of one song to the beginning
of the next song.

Paired markers define a *range* that encompasses a song. This works best
when there are gaps between songs in the session. In that case, for each
song, the cue sheet will also contain the \'INDEX 00\' section that will
reference the beginning of the pregap --- the gap between songs. This
will tell CD authoring software which parts of the audio file to exclude
from burning to a CD. The TOC file will create ranges exactly as defined
by paired CD markers.

## Editing CD Markers

There are several ways to rename CD markers (both single and paired
ones):

- Double-clicking on a marker or right-clicking on it and selecting the
  [Rename...]{.kbd .menu} (single markers) or the [Rename Range]{.kbd
  .menu} (paired markers) menu item brings up the dialog where the name
  can be changed.
- The name can also be changed in the [Ranges & Marks]{.kbd .window}
  sidebar by replacing the existing one and pressing the [Enter]{.kbd}
  key.

CD marker name is primarily the name of the track visible in software
and equipment capable of displaying individual track names. Other disc
metadata, such as band name, year, total count of tracks etc. is defined
in the [Edit Session Metadata](@@metadata) dialog.

There are additional fields for CD markers only available for editing in
the [Ranges & Marks]{.kbd .window} sidebar. All this extra information
is written only into CUE and TOC files for CD authoring software.

  SCMS           This enables the Serial Copy Management System (SCMS) which is a copy protection scheme that targets the use of digital audio tape (DAT) and allows the first generation of copies of the original track while preventing the second generation of copies (copies of copies).
  Pre-Emphasis   This targets the use of older CD playback equipment that uses a 14-bit converter (while dealing with 16-bit data) and noisy filters to remove frequencies higher than 22050 Hz (the Nyquist frequency). Unless treated specifically, the use of such equipment results in noise especially audible in higher frequencies. The pre-emphasis flag tells the CD authoring software to do two things: apply an equalization curve to boost higher, \"weaker\" frequencies, as well as write a pre-emphasis flag to the subcode stored alongside audio data so that playback software or equipment capable of de-emphasizing would process the data accordingly.

## Removing CD Markers

CD markers can be deleted in several ways:

- By clicking a marker and pressing the [Del]{.kbd} key.
- By right-clicking on a markers and selecting [Remove]{.kbd .menu}
  (single marker) or [Remove Range]{.kbd .menu} (paired marker).
- By clicking the markers\' [x]{.kbd} button in the *Ranges & Marks*
  sidebar.

## More Options

The [right]{.kbd .mouse}-click menu for single and paired CD markers
replicates that of [location markers](@@creating-location-markers) and
[range markers](@@creating-range-markers) respectively.
