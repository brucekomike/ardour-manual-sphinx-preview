# Range Markers
[Range markers]{.dfn} are essentially two [location
markers](@@creating-location-markers) that appear in the [Range
Markers](@@ruler) ruler, and are grouped together to mark the beginning
and end of a section on the timeline.

Ardour combines regular range markers, loop ranges, and punch ranges in
the same Range Markers ruler.

## Creating a Range on the Timeline {#creating-range-on-timeline}

There are multiple ways to create range markers:

- [Right]{.kbd .mouse}-clicking on the Range Markers ruler at the top of
  the timeline, then selecting [Add \> Range]{.kbd .menu}. For loop
  ranges and punch ranges, please select [Add \> Loop Range]{.kbd .menu}
  and [Add \> Punch Range]{.kbd .menu} respectively.
- Selecting a range in the Editor window, then [right]{.kbd
  .mouse}-clicking and selecting [Add Range Markers]{.kbd .menu}, [Set
  Loop from Selection]{.kbd .menu} or [Set Punch from Selection]{.kbd
  .menu}.
- Clicking [New Range]{.kbd .button} button at the bottom of the
  [Ranges & Marks]{.kbd .window} sidebar. The markers will be created
  around the playhead position, unless the playhead in at the time
  origin (in which case the markers will be placed at the time origin
  position).
- [Right]{.kbd .mouse}-clicking a location or a CD marker and selecting
  [Create Range to Next Marker]{.kbd .menu}. This will create a pair of
  range markers that start at the selected marked and end at the
  position of the next location or CD marker (both rulers are taken into
  account).

## Editing a Range {#editing-range}

Both markers of a range can be independently moved along the timeline by
clicking and dragging them to the desired location. They can also be
moved together by []{.kbd .mod2n}-dragging one of the markers.

Any pair or range markers, including session start/end markers, can be
repositioned to the extents of an existing range selection on the
timeline by [right]{.kbd .mouse}-clicking on either of the markers and
selecting [Set Range from Selection]{.kbd .menu} in the menu.

### Renaming Range Markers

Ardour provides several ways to rename an existing pair of range
markers:

- Double-clicking either of the two range markers will show a dialog for
  setting a new caption for the markers.
- The same can be achieved by right-clicking on either of the markers
  and selecting the [Rename Range...]{.kbd .menu} menu item.
- Additionally, the name can be edited in the [Ranges & Marks]{.kbd
  .window} sidebar.

## Removing Range Markers

Range markers can be deleted in several ways:

- By clicking on one of the markers and pressing the [Del]{.kbd} key.
- By right-clicking on one of the markers and selecting [Remove
  Range]{.kbd .menu}.
- By clicking the markers\' [x]{.kbd .button} button in the *Ranges &
  Marks* sidebar.

Additionally, all ranges can be removed at once by [right]{.kbd
.mouse}-clicking on an empty part of the Range Markers ruler and
selecting the [Clear All Ranges]{.kbd .menu} menu item.

## More Options

The context (right-click) menu for range markers has more options than
the ones mentioned above:

  --------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Play Range                  Starts playback at the left marker in the pair and stops at the right marker.
  Locate to Marker            Moves the playhead to the selected marker.
  Play from Marker            Moves the playhead to the selected marker and starts playback.
  Loop Range                  Creates a loop range off the selected range markers pair and starts playback.
  Set Marker from Playhead    Changes the position of the selected marker to that of the playhead.
  Zoom to Range               Changes the zoom so that the area defined by the range markers would be maximized yet visible entirely within Ardour\'s window.
  Loudness Assistant...       Launches the Loudness Assistant to analyze the selection defined by the selected pair of range markers.
  Export Range...             Exports the selection defined by the selected pair of range markers.
  Promote to Time Origin      This makes the position of the chosen range marker the origin time. This is mostly useful when the *Display delta to origin marker* clock mode is enabled to display the difference between current playhead position and the origin time. Absolute time stays unaffected.
  Hide Range                  This hides the range from the Range Markers ruler. Marker\'s visibility can be restored in the *Ranges & Marks* sidebar.
  Separate Regions in Range   Cuts all regions crossing the positions of the range markers.
  Select All in Range         Select entire regions that cross the borders of the range markers.
  Select Range                Create a selection from the range markers in all selected tracks and busses.
