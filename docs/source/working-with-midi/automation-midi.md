# Pitch Bend &amp; Aftertouch
Adding pitch bending or aftertouch can add a lot of subtlety to an
otherwise plain sounding midi region and help humanize it.

Pitch bending and aftertouch both work the same way, through automation,
by [right]{.kbd .mouse} clicking the MIDI track\'s header [\> Automation
\> Bender (or Pressure) \> the channel to bend]{.kbd .menu}.

Using the Draw tool, as for all the automations, allows to create a
gradual change from one drawn point to another. A line in the center
produces no change to the pitch, while a line above the center will bend
the pitch to a higher note and a line going under the middle will bend
the pitch to a lower note.

The pitch change depends on the synth-plugin used. Common ranges are an
change of either ± 1, ± 2 or ± 4 semitones for the range 0 to 16383. The
range is usually defined by the soundfont for each instrument. A value
of 8192, which is also the default, means no pitch change.

Aftertouch works very similarly, though the values are between 0 and
127. It should be noted that aftertouch differs from velocity, as
aftertouch allows to slightly change the timbre or create a vibrato,
while the velocity sets the power with which the note is played (e.g. on
a keyboard, the key is hit).
