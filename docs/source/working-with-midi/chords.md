# Adding and Editing Chords
The Chord Editing part of the pianoroll sidebar helps insert new chords
to MIDI regions and edit existing chords.

The pianoroll sidebar is hidden by default for both pianoroll windows
and the bottom region editor. To enable it, click on this button in the
toolbar:

The controls in Chord Editing are separated into the following groups:

  Group                     Can create new chords   Can edit existing chords
  ------------------------- ----------------------- --------------------------
  3-Note Chords (Triads)    Yes                     Yes
  4-Note Chords (Tetrads)   Yes                     Yes
  Extended Chords           Yes                     Yes
  Inversions                No                      Yes
  Drop Notes                No                      Yes

## Adding chords

To add a new 3-note, 4-note, or an extended chord, follow these steps:

1.  For an already opened MIDI region, switch to the Draw mode.
2.  Click on the pencil button next to the chord you want to add.
3.  Draw the root note in the region.

The rest of the chord\'s note will be added as soon as you stop drawing
the root note.

## Editing chords

Ardour provides three ways to manipulate the existing chords in MIDI
regions: changing them to other chords (swapping), inverting them, and
dropping notes.

### Swapping chords {#changing-chords}

To change an existing chord to a different one, follow these steps:

1.  Select all the chord notes. Ardour will attempt to identify the
    chord and display it at the top of the Chord Editing section.
2.  Find the chord you want to change it to and click on the respective
    button.

Note that you can freely switch between 3-note, 4-note, and extended
chords, e.g., go from a 3-note chord to a 5-note chord and vice versa.

### Inverting chords

You can invert chords by either moving the lowest pitch up by 1 octave
(Move Up) or moving the highest pitch down by 1 octave (Move Down).

To invert a chord, follow these steps:

1.  Select all the chord notes.
2.  Click on one of the two buttons: Move Up or Move Down.

### Dropping notes

You can transform tight, closely-spaced chords into wider, more open
ones. Ardour provides three options to do that:

- Drop 2: moves the second lowest pitch by 1 octave
- Drop 3: moves the thiord lowest pitch by 1 octave
- Drop 2+4: moves the second and the fourth pitches by 1 octave

To drop notes, follow these steps:

1.  Select all the chord notes.
2.  Click on one of the two buttons: Drop 2, Drop 3, or Drop 2+4.
