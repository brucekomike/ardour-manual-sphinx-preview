# Pianoroll Window
Pianoroll windows are a conventional user interface for editing MIDI
data. It\'s possible to open several regions for editing in dedicated
pianoroll windows at a time:

1.  Select one or multiple MIDI regions on the timeline.
2.  Right-click, then select [{region name} \> Edit in a separate
    window...]{.kbd .menu}

The user interface largely resembles that of in-place editing in the
main window on the timeline.

2.  Editor toolbar
3.  Note editing area
4.  Automation editing area

## MIDI Inspector pane

The MIDI Inspector pane contains three section:

- Chord Editing
- Quantize
- Region Properties

The pane is hidden by default. To enable it, click on this button in the
toolbar:

style="width:75%"}

### Chord Editing

The Chord Editing part of the pianoroll sidebar helps insert new chords
to MIDI regions and edit existing chords.

For a guide on adding and editing chords, see [Adding and Editing
Chords](@@midi-chords).

### Quantize

The Quantize section of the pane help quickly quantize notes to a
specific grid unit for captured live MIDI performance.

![Quantize in pianoroll
interfaces](/images/pianoroll-window-quantize.png){style="width:75%"}

The user interface is the same as in the separate [Quantize
dialog](@@quantize-midi) used in the inline MIDI editor of the main
Editor window. To apply quantization in the pianoroll window, select
notes, set quantization parameters, then hover over the notes, and press
[Q]{.kbd}.

### Region properties

<img src="/images/pianoroll-window-region-properties.png" class="mini"
style="width:500px;" alt="Region properties" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Region properties</figcaption>
</figure>

Displays essential information about the MIDI region:

- Name: the name of the region
- Source: the MIDI file where the notes are stored
- Position: where on the timeline the region starts
- End: where on the timeline the region ends
- Length: the duration of the region
- File start: where the visible part of the region begins, counting from
  the region\'s start
- Sync point (relative to the region)
- Sync point (absolute)

## Editor toolbar

The editor toolbar provides playback, editing, and zoom controls.

<figure class="right">
<img src="/images/pianoroll-window-toolbar.png" style="width:100.0%"
alt="Pianoroll toobar" />
</figure>

Playback controls:

- Play once starting at the beginning of the region
- Loop-playback the region until stopped
- Solo toggle for the track where the region is located

Note display controls:

- Select visible MIDI channel: notes on this channel will be editable,
  notes on other channels will be displayed as ghost notes that cannot
  be edited
- Note mode selector: whether to display notes in regular or drum
  (diamond-shaped) mode
- Follow playhead: whether the pianoroll window should automatically
  scroll horizontally to follow the playhead

Note editing controls:

- Draw vs Edit mode selection
- Snapping toggle: enables or disables snapping to selected grid units
- Grid mode: allows selecting a specific grid unit or no grid at all
- Length: default note length for notes created by single-clicking on
  the timeline
- Velocity: default note velocity. The \'Auto\' option inherits the
  velocity from the nearest note

Zoom controls:

- Zoom in
- Zoom out
- Zoom to show the entire region
- Zoom focus mode

## Note area

This areas displays all editable notes and provides control for panning
between staves and tweaking the beginning and the end of the region.

<figure class="right">
<img src="/images/pianoroll-window-editing-area.png"
style="width:100.0%" alt="Note editing area in the pianoroll window" />
</figure>

The area on the left controls the visible note range. [See
here](@@controlling-midi-range) for the detailed explanation how to use
the widget.

The orange handles on the left and on the right control the start and
the end of the region\'s visible part. For example, dragging the orange
start marker (on the left) to the right is equivalent to using the Grab
tool to pick the left side of the region and trim the beginning of the
region.

Drawing and editing MIDI notes works the same way as in the main window:

- Select the Draw mode and then click and drag to add a note.
  Alternatively, press and hold [Shift]{.kbd} and click and drag to
  brush notes at the interval defined by global quantization.
- Select the Edit mode, click on a note or rubberband-select multiple
  note, then click and drag notes by their middle to move them, or click
  and drag on the left or the right side of one note to trim or extend.

## Automation area

This area displays note velocity and controllers and is disabled by
default. The area can display data from multiple controllers, stacked
above each other.

style="width:100.0%" alt="Automation area in the pianoroll window" />
</figure>

To enable or disable an automation lane, click the [A]{.kbd} button at
the right end of the pianoroll toolbar and select a controller.

<figure class="right">
<img src="/images/pianoroll-window-add-automation.png"
style="width:50.0%"
alt="Add automation lanes in the pianoroll window" />
</figure>

You can toggle multiple lanes by hovering over them one by one and
pressing spacebar on your keyboard.

To draw new automation or edit existing one, use the Draw and Internal
Edit modes just like when you do [edit automation in the main Editor
window](@@automation).

To clear all automation in a lane, click on the respective Clear button.
