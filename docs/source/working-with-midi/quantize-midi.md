# Quantizing MIDI

Quantizing a MIDI region, usually one recorded from a MIDI instrument,
consists in perfectly aligning the notes with the grid by shifting the
notes positions to the closest grid line. The result is a perfectly
timed MIDI region, allowing to correct rhythmically poor performance.

This dialog is accessed via the [Region \> MIDI \> Quantize\...]{.kbd
.menu} while having a MIDI region selected, or by [right]{.kbd .mouse}
clicking a MIDI region, [*Name_Of_The_Region* \> MIDI \>
Quantize\...]{.kbd .menu} or with the default [5]{.kbd .mod2} shortcut
and includes:

  ------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Snap note start     If checked, the start of the notes will be aligned to the grid as defined in the following combo-box (see below)
  Snap note end       If checked, the end of the notes will be aligned to the grid as defined in the following combo-box (see below)
  Threshold (ticks)   Defines how close from a grid point a note must be in order to be quantized. Notes farther than this number of [ticks](@@timecode-generators-and-slaves) will not be affected.
  Strength            Defines how close to its new position the note must be moved, as a percentage of the nominal distance (allowing for a non-perfect quantization, i.e. just making the performance rhythmically better without giving it a machine-generated feel)
  Swing               Applies a *swing* to the midi notes, i.e. delays every 2nd note by this amount, to e.g. simulate a groovy drummer
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The grid selection combo boxes allow a choice between the current *main
grid*, or many beat subdivisions.

Both note start and note end can be selected at once, resulting in a
2-pass quantization: the note starts are aligned to the grid (with or
without the [swing]{.kbd .menu} and [Strength]{.kbd .menu} parameters),
then their ends are aligned.

The swing is a value between 0 and 130, and is relative to the
user-selected grid type: every note which is considered a second note
(i.e. close enough to an odd grid line as per the threshold value) will
be delayed by this number of ticks.
