# Managing Plugin Presets
All plugin control widgets, whether they are created by Ardour or by the
plugin, have a common set of controls at the top of the window. These
include 4 controls for managing [plugin presets]{.dfn}.

## What Is a Plugin Preset?

A [preset]{.dfn} for a plugin is simply a saved set of values for all of
a plugin\'s parameters. If you load a preset, you are restoring all the
parameters of that plugin to the values stored in the preset. This is an
easy, fast way to manage your preferred settings for particular plugins.

## The Preset Selector

The [preset selector]{.dfn} (1) is a regular selector that can be
clicked to display a list of all known presets for this plugin. This
will include presets that have been created by the user, and for some
plugin formats, presets that come with the plugin itself.

## Loading a New Preset

Clicking on the preset selector pops up a menu showing the names of all
available presets. Clicking on the name of a preset loads it, and
various controls in the plugin editor change to reflect the new value of
some or all parameters.

## Creating a Preset

Saving the current plugin settings as a new preset is done by clicking
on the [Add]{.kbd .menu} button (2) at the top of the window. A dialog
will appear asking for a name for the preset.

## Saving a Preset

To modify the settings in an existing preset, the preset selector must
be used to load the preset, then, when the settings have been adjusted,
the [Save]{.kbd .menu} button (3) clicked. The new values will be
stored, overwriting the previous version of this preset.

## Deleting a preset

Deleting an existing preset is achieved by loading the preset first,
then clicking the [Delete]{.kbd .menu} button (4). The preset will be
removed, and the preset selector turns blank, showing that no preset is
currently loaded (although the settings will stay as they were).
