# Plugin Manager
The [Plugin Manager]{.dfn} provides a convenient interface to various
operations on plugins and is the primary troubleshooting tool when
something goes wrong with plugins. It works on both plugin files and the
plugins index.

## What is a plugins index?

For each type of a plugin (e.g. VST3 or AU) there are pre-configured
paths where these plugins are located. Every time Ardour runs, it
re-scans plugins in these paths and recreates an index --- a kind of
inventory of available plugins. Whenever you open the [Plugin
Selector](@@plugin-selector) dialog, Ardour reads the list of available
plugins from that index and displays them for you to pick.

Re-scanning paths is important because it\'s common for plugins to
change on the disk (e.g. when you installed a newer version) or get
removed (when you don\'t need a plugin anymore). Sometimes plugins get
corrupted due to a hardware failure. Indexing them often helps
identifying issues early on, and the Plugin Manager helps reviewing the
general state of affairs with plugins.

Ardour also treats LV2 plugins slightly differently and scans them on
startup unconditionally. You can disable the scanning of VST2, VST3, and
AU plugins entirely in the [Preferences]{.kbd .menu} dialog.

## Plugins info

The main part of the Plugin Manager window is the table where all
plugins known to Ardour are listed. You can use it to both view
information about a plugin and control some of its aspects:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| Status | Ardour will displays the status of every plug-in file. See below for more information |
| Ign | Do not load this plugin file at all |
| Fav | Set or unset the Favorite status for a plugin |
| Hide | Load this plugin file, but do not show it in the Plugin Selector |
| Type | The name of the API this plugin has been built with: VST2, VST3, AU, LADSPA, LV2 |
| File/ID | Displays the file name for LADSPA, VST2, and VST3, as well as the ID for LV2 and AU |
| Name | User-visible name of the plugin |
| Creator | Developer of team of developers who created the plugin |
| Tags | Metadata that classifies the plugin by type, e.g. \'instrument\|synth\' or \'analyzer\' |

The Status field specifically has the following options:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| OK | The plugin file has loaded without any issues and the information in the cache about it is up to date |
| New | The plugin file has just been discovered and successfully loaded for the first time |
| Updated | The plugin file changed on the disk, the plugin cache has been updated accordingly, the plugin file loaded successfully |
| Concealed | A VST2 plugin will be hidden from Plugin Selector, if a corresponding VST3 plugin exists. The same applies to LV1 (LADSPA) and LV2 |
| Error | There was a problem loading the plugin file |
| Stale | A plugin changed on the disk but hasn\'t been re-scanned by Ardour yet |
| Incompatible | Scan the plugin failed. Typical reasons are 32/64-bit mismatch, attempt to load a .dll on Linux or a .dylib on Windows |

The [Plugin Count]{.kbd .menu} section in the sidebar provides basic
information on available plugins: how many plugins of every supported
type are available through Ardour in total, how many failed to load, and
how many are missing.

## Searching

You can search for a specific plugin or a group of plugins. Simply place
the cursor inside the input text box in the upper left corner and type.
Ardour will search in the index

By default, Ardour will search through plugin names, makers, and file
names. Additionally, you can search through Type, Tags, and Paths.

## Scan actions

This section of the sidebar contains commands that operate on the
plugins index.

|  |  |
|----|----|
| Discover New/Updated | This will run a full scan on all known paths to plugin of all supported types |
| Update Index Only | This will check which plugins were updated without scanning them |
| Re-scan Selected | This will re-scan plugin files selected in the main part of the window |
| Re-scan Faulty | This will only re-scan plugins that previously failed to load |
| Re-scan All | This will re-scan all currently known plugins |
| Clear Staled Scan Log | This will remove all entries from the index on plugins that changed on the disk but haven\'t been re-scanned |

## Preferences

This section of the sidebar allows settings paths to VST2 and VST3
plugins, as well as quickly open the [Preferences]{.kbd .menu} dialog on
the [Plugins]{.kbd .menu} page where you can set various options for
scanning plugins and controlling their default behavior.
