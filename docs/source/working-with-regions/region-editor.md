# Region Editor Pane
The region editor is located at the bottom of Editor and Cue windows. To
open a MIDI region for editing, make sure the [bottom pane is
enabled](@@other-toolbar-items) and click on a region in the timeline.

The user interface largely resembles that of in-place editing in the
main window on the timeline and is the same as in the [pianoroll
windows](@@pianoroll-window).

## Region properties pane

Displays essential information about the MIDI region:

- Name: the name of the region
- Source: the MIDI file where the notes are stored
- Position: where on the timeline the region starts
- End: where on the timeline the region ends
- Length: the duration of the region
- File start: where the visible part of the region begins, counting from
  the region\'s start
- Sync point (relative to the region)
- Sync point (absolute)

## Editor toolbar

The editor toolbar provides playback, editing, and zoom controls.

</figure>

Playback controls:

- Play once starting at the beginning of the region
- Loop-playback the region until stopped
- Solo toggle for the track where the region is located

Note display controls:

- Select visible MIDI channel: notes on this channel will be editable,
  notes on other channels will be displayed as ghost notes that cannot
  be edited
- Note mode selector: whether to display notes in regular or drum
  (diamond-shaped) mode
- Follow playhead: whether the pianoroll window should automatically
  scroll horizontally to follow the playhead

Note editing controls:

- Draw vs Edit mode selection
- Snapping toggle: enables or disables snapping to selected grid units
- Grid mode: allows selecting a specific grid unit or no grid at all
- Length: default note length for notes created by single-clicking on
  the timeline
- Velocity: default note velocity. The \'Auto\' option inherits the
  velocity from the nearest note

Zoom controls:

- Zoom in
- Zoom out
- Zoom to show the entire region
- Zoom focus mode

## Note or audio waveform area

For MIDI regions or clips, this areas displays all editable notes and
provides control for panning between staves and tweaking the beginning
and the end of the region.

style="width:100.0%" alt="Note editing area in the pianoroll window" />
</figure>

The area on the left controls the visible note range. [See
here](@@controlling-midi-range) for the detailed explanation how to use
the widget.

The orange handles on the left and on the right control the start and
the end of the region\'s visible part. For example, dragging the orange
start marker (on the left) to the right is equivalent to using the Grab
tool to pick the left side of the region and trim the beginning of the
region.

Drawing and editing MIDI notes works the same way as in the main window:

- Select the Draw mode and then click and drag to add a note.
  Alternatively, press and hold [Shift]{.kbd} and click and drag to
  brush notes at the interval defined by global quantization.
- Select the Edit mode, click on a note or rubberband-select multiple
  note, then click and drag notes by their middle to move them, or click
  and drag on the left or the right side of one note to trim or extend.

## Automation area

For MIDI regions and clips, this area displays note velocity and
controllers and is disabled by default. Clicking on any of the available
controller options (Velocity, Bender, Pressure, Modulation) enables it.

</figure>

To enable or disable an automation lane, click on the small LED
indicator to the left of its name on the bottom toolbar.

The area can display data from multiple controllers, overlaid on top of
each other, but only one automation lane is editable at the time.

To select the automation lane to edit, click on the controller name. The
lane data will become editable, and the relevant button will get a red
outline (Velocity on the screenshot above).
