# Interchange with other DAWs
It has never been particularly easy to move sessions or projects from
one [DAW]{.abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation"} to another. There are
two [interchange standards]{.dfn} that have reasonably widespread
support:

- OMF (Open Media Framework), also known as OMFI. Developed and
  controlled by Avid, never standardized
- AAF (Advanced Authoring Format). Developed by a consortium of
  media-related corporations.

In practice both of these standards have such complex and/or incomplete
specifications that different DAWs support them only partially,
differently, or not at all.

## Transferring an Ardour session from / to another DAW

To move a session from another DAW to Ardour, or from Ardour to another
DAW, there are two basic choices:

- [Stem exports](@@stem-exports)
- [Using AATranslator](#using-aatranslator)

## Importing AAF files

Ardour supports importing AAF session files, including fades, volume
automation, pan and multichannel tracks/regions.

To import an AAF file, you have to open the session file selection
dialog :

- By clicking the [Other Sessions]{.kbd .menu} button on the [Session
  Setup Dialog](@@newopen-session-dialog),
- Or by going to [Session \> Open\...]{.kbd .menu} menu.

Select [Advanced Authoring Format (AAF)]{.kbd .menu} in the file type
filter, then select an AAF file and click [Open]{.kbd .menu}.

## Importing ProTools® files

Ardour provides a basic import tool for ProTools® sessions, in the
[Session \> Import PT Session]{.kbd .menu} menu.

Though incomplete, this import is intended for ptf and ptx files.
Protools® 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 have been tested with varying degrees of
success. (versions 6 and 7 are not supported).

The elements of the files that are imported are:

- Audio regions data & position
- MIDI notes (fused to a unique region).

## Using AATranslator

[AATranslator]{.dfn} is a Windows application that can convert
sessions/projects from many different DAWs into other formats. At the
present time (December 2016), it can read and write Ardour 2.X sessions,
and can read Ardour 3 sessions.

The program runs very well on Linux using [Wine](http://www.winehq.org/)
(a Windows environment for Linux). There are equivalent solutions for
running Windows applications on OS X, but we have no experience with
them at this time. Ardour users have reported great results using
AATranslator on Ardour 2.X sessions.

The [AATranslator website](http://www.aatranslator.com.au/) has full
details on supported formats and DAWs. The list includes ProTools, Live,
Reaper, OMF, AAF and many more.

AATranslator is closed-source, non-free software (as of this writing,
June 2017, the cost is 59 USD for the \"Standard\" version, and 199 USD
for the \"Enhanced\" version).
