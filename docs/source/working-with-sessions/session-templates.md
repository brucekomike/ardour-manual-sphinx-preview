# Session Templates
[Session templates]{.dfn} are a way to store the setup of a session for
future use. They do not store any *audio* data but can store:

- The number of tracks and busses, along with their names
- The plugins present on each track or bus (if any)
- All I/O connections

## Creating a Session Template

The [Session \> Save Template]{.kbd .menu} shows a dialog asking for the
name of the new template, and a description.

## Using a Session Template

In the [New Session dialog](@@newopen-session-dialog), a panel lists the
different template (factory and user-created).

## Managing Templates

To manage templates, choose **Window** \> **Templates**. To access this
menu item, you have to have a session open.

Both Session templates and Track Templates can be managed through the
Manage Templates window, which can perform the following actions:

- Renaming a template
- Removing one
- Adding/modifying its description
- Exporting the templates (e.g. to be used in another Ardour instance)
- Importing templates (from e.g. another Ardour instance).

See also [Adding Tracks and Busses](@@adding-tracks-busses-and-vcas) for
information on templates for individual tracks or busses.
