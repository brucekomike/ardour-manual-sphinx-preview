# New/Open Session Dialog
The initial [Session]{.dfn} dialog, displayed at each start of Ardour,
consists of several consecutive pages:

## Recent Page {#recent-sessions}

<figure class="left">
<img src="/images/session_setup.png" class="mini"
alt="The Session Setup Dialog" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Session Setup Dialog</figcaption>
</figure>

On this page, an [existing session]{.dfn} can be opened. Any
[snapshot](@@snapshots) of a particular session can also be accessed by
clicking on the arrow next to the session name to display all snapshots,
and then selecting one.

If the session is not displayed in the Recent Sessions list, the [Other
Sessions]{.kbd .menu} button will bring up a file selection dialog to
navigate the file system.

Alternatively, a [New Session]{.kbd .menu} can be created.

## Open Page {#open-sessions}

<figure class="left">
<img src="/images/open-session-page.png" class="mini"
alt="The Open page" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Open page</figcaption>
</figure>

This page allows to open an arbitrary session from the disk.

Available options are:

- Regular Ardour sessions
- Ardour session archives
- Sessions in the Advanced Authoring Format (AAF)

## New Page {#new-sessions}

<figure class="left">
<img src="/images/session_new.png" class="mini"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The New Session Dialog</figcaption>
</figure>

This page allows to type in the name of a session, select a folder to
save it in, and optionally use an existing
[template](@@session-templates). The different templates, both the
\"factory\" ones and the ones created by the user, are easily available
on the left-side panel.

<figure class="right">
<img src="/images/template-setup.png" class="mini"
alt="Template Setup dialog" />
<figcaption>Template Setup dialog for the Advanced template</figcaption>
</figure>

Depending on the chosen template, a specific Template Setup window may
be shown, allowing the user to fine-tune the details of the template
and/or choose between the different options of the template.

Templates can be huge time savers when working on similar projects, or
on usual projects, as they allow to preset and tweak a lot of the
[session properties](@@session-properties), (like the availability of a
[monitoring section](@@monitor-section), connection to a Master Bus,
etc.), and handle the creation of
[tracks](@@adding-tracks-busses-and-vcas) of any kind.

The [Empty Template]{.kbd .menu} preset allows to create a session
\"from scratch\". Everything a session template does can be done
manually ---albeit more tediously--- and the resulting sessions will not
differ whatsoever.

As of Ardour 5.12, which introduced the new template dialog, the factory
templates are:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| [Empty Template]{.kbd .menu} | Creates an empty session with no tracks and no monitoring. A stereo Master Bus is created, and any track created defaults to output on this bus. |
| [Advanced Session]{.kbd .menu} | Like the Empty Template, but adds the ability to easily manage the Master bus (channels, hardware connection, and track autoconnection), and the creation of a monitoring section. |
| [Recording Session]{.kbd .menu} | Like the Empty Template, but allows the fast creation of a number of tracks, optionally ready to record. |
| [Live Band]{.kbd .menu} | Fast tracks the creation of usual tracks for a band setup (vocals, guitars, piano, \...), and optionally adds usual effects on these tracks. |

Selecting a template will display its description in the right-side
panel, while hovering over a template name will show a tooltip
indicating if it is a factory template, or, if it is a user-created one,
which version of Ardour was used to create it.

Whether or not a template is used, and before the \"Template Setup\"
dialog, the [Audio/MIDI Setup](@@audio-midi-setup) will be shown.

The New Session dialog also allows selecting session\'s time domain ---
either audio time or beat (musical) time. This defines the defaut
selection of visible timeline rulers and units in which various markers
operate in.
