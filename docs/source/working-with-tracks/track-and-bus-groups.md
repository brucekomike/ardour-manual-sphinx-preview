# Track and Bus Groups
Tracks and busses can be put into [groups]{.dfn}. Members of a group can
share various settings---useful for managing tracks that are closely
related to each other. Examples might include tracks that contain
multiple-microphone recordings of a single source (an acoustic guitar,
perhaps, or a drum kit).

</figure>

Tracks and busses can be grouped in various ways. In the editor window,
a track\'s controls might look like the adjacent image.

The green tab to the left of the track header indicates that this track
is in a group called `Fred`{.sample}. These tabs can be dragged to add
adjacent tracks to a group.

## Create New Groups

There are several ways to [create groups]{.dfn} for tracks and busses:

- [Right]{.kbd .mouse}-clicking on the group tab and using one of the
  [Create...]{.kbd .menu} options there. A group can be created with no
  members, or one that starts with the currently selected tracks, or
  record-enabled tracks, or soloed tracks.
- Alternatively, clicking the [g]{.kbd .menu} button on a track header
  to open the Group menu. The menu lists the available groups. Selecting
  one of these groups will add the track or bus to that group. The menu
  also allows creating a new group.
- Finally, the [Track and Bus Groups
  list](@@the-track-and-bus-group-list) has a [plus (+)]{.kbd .menu}
  button at the bottom of the list that can be clicked on to create a
  new group.

## Remove Groups

Context-clicking on a [group tab]{.dfn} and selecting [Remove
Group]{.kbd .menu} from the menu removes it. Removing a group does *not*
remove the members of a group.

Groups can also be removed by selecting them in the [Track and Bus
Groups list](@@the-track-and-bus-group-list) and then pressing the
[minus (−)]{.kbd .menu} button at the bottom of the list.

## Add/Remove Tracks and Busses From a Group

Clicking the [g]{.kbd .menu} button displays a menu with a list of the
available groups. Selecting one of these groups adds the track or bus to
that group. Selecting [No Group]{.kbd .menu} removes it.

Alternatively, a group tab can be dragged to add or remove tracks from
the group.

## Activate/Deactivate Groups via the Group Tab

Clicking on a group tab toggles the group between being active and
inactive. An inactive group has no effect when editing its members. An
active group will share its configured properties across its members.
Tabs for disabled groups are coloured grey.

## Modify Group Properties

alt="The Track/bus Group dialog" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Track/bus Group dialog</figcaption>
</figure>

Edit the properties of a group is done by [right]{.kbd .mouse}-clicking
on its tab and choosing [Edit Group...]{.kbd .menu}. This opens the
track/bus group dialog, which is also used when creating new groups.

### Group Color

Clicking on the color selector button changes a group\'s color. This
affects the color of the group\'s tab in the editor and mixer windows.
The color does *not* affect the color of the group members unless the
shared [Color]{.kbd .menu} property is enabled.

### Shared Properties

[Gain]{.kbd .option} means that the track faders will be synced to
always have the same value; [Relative]{.kbd .option} means that the gain
changes are applied relative to each member\'s current value. If, for
example, there are two tracks in a group with relative gain sharing, and
their faders are set to −3 dB and −1 dB, a change of the first track to
a gain of −6 dB will result in the second track having a gain of −4 dB
(the *difference* of the gains remains the same).

[[Muting]{.kbd .option}](@@bus-controls), [[Soloing]{.kbd
.option}](@@bus-controls), [[record enable]{.kbd
.option}](@@audio-track-controls#audiotrack-record), [[active
state]{.kbd .option}](@@the-tracks-and-busses-list), [[color]{.kbd
.option}](@@track-color) and [[monitoring]{.kbd .option}](@@monitoring)
are all straightforward. They simply mean that all member tracks or
busses will share the same settings in these respects.

[Selection]{.kbd .option} means that if a region is selected or
deselected on one member track, [corresponding
regions](@@corresponding-regions-selection) on other member tracks will
be similarly selected. Since region editing operations are applied to
all currently selected regions, this is the way to make edits apply
across all tracks in the group.

### Overriding grouped status

It\'s possible to override the shared status of any properties of a
group. Holding []{.kbd .mod3} while clicking on a grouped channel\'s
Mute, Record Enable, In & Out monitoring controls, or fader, will invert
the sense of sharing of that control.

For example, if a channel is a member of an active group with \"Record
Enable\" shared, []{.kbd .mod3}+click on that channel\'s Record Enable
button will toggle only that channel\'s record enabled status. If a
channel is a member of an inactive group, or of an active group that
does not have \"Record Enable\" shared, []{.kbd .mod3}+click on that
channel\'s Record Enable button will enable or disable the record enable
status of all channels in the same group.

### Group Tab Context Menu

Context-clicking on the group tab offers a further menu of group-related
actions.

  Add New Subgroup Bus       creates a bus (giving it the name of the group) and connects the output of each member to the new bus.
  Add New Aux Bus            adds a bus and gives each member a send to that bus. There are two options for this, specifying whether the sends should be placed pre- or post-fader.
  Fit to Window              will zoom the member tracks so that they fill the editor window.
  Enable All Groups          makes all group active, including any hidden groups.
  Disable All Groups         makes all groups inactive, including any hidden groups.
