# Track Context Menu
Within the editor window, context-clicking ([right]{.kbd .mouse} click)
on either a region or empty space within a track displays the [track
context menu]{.dfn}. The context menu provides easy access to many
track-level operations.

If a [region]{.dfn} is clicked, the first item in the menu is the name
of the region. If a [layered region](@@layering-display) is clicked, the
next item in the menu is [Choose Top]{.kbd .menu}. If selected, a dialog
appears that allows to change the vertical order of layers at that
point. See [Layering Display](@@layering-display) for more details.

The rest of the track context menu is structured as follows:

  ---------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
