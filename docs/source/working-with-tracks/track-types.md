# Track Types
Ardour offers three [track types]{.dfn} depending on the type of data
they contain, and differentiates between three [track modes]{.dfn},
depending on their recording behaviour.

## Track types

An Ardour track can be of type [audio]{.dfn} or [MIDI]{.dfn}, depending
on the [data]{.dfn} that the track will primarily record and play back.
*However, either type of track can pass either type of data.* Hence, for
example, one might have a MIDI track that contains an instrument plugin;
such a track would record and play back MIDI data from disk but would
produce audio, since the instrument plugin would turn MIDI data into
audio data.

Nevertheless, when adding tracks to a session, its content is typically
known, and Ardour offers three choices:

+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Audio                             | An [Audio Track]{.dfn} is created with a  |
|                                   | user-specified number of inputs. The      |
|                                   | number of outputs is defined by the       |
|                                   | master bus channel count (for details see |
|                                   | [Channel                                  |
|                                   | Configuration](@@channel-configuration)). |
|                                   | This is the type of track to use when     |
|                                   | planning to work with existing or newly   |
|                                   | recorded audio.                           |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| MIDI                              | A [MIDI track]{.dfn} is created with a    |
|                                   | single MIDI input, and a single MIDI      |
|                                   | output. This is the type of track to use  |
|                                   | when planning to record and play back     |
|                                   | MIDI. There are several methods to enable |
|                                   | playback of a MIDI track: add an          |
|                                   | instrument plugin to the track, connect   |
|                                   | the track to a software synthesizer, or   |
|                                   | connect it to external MIDI hardware.     |
|                                   |                                           |
|                                   | If an instrument plugin is added, the     |
|                                   | MIDI track outputs audio alongside MIDI   |
|                                   | data.                                     |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Audio/MIDI                        | There are a few notable plugins that can  |
|                                   | usefully accept both [Audio and           |
|                                   | MIDI]{.dfn} data (Reaktor is one, and     |
|                                   | various \"auto-tune\" like plugins are    |
|                                   | another). It can be tricky to configure   |
|                                   | this type of track manually, so Ardour    |
|                                   | allows to select this type specifically   |
|                                   | for use with such plugins. It is *not*    |
|                                   | generally the right choice when working   |
|                                   | normal MIDI tracks, and a dialog will     |
|                                   | warn of this.                             |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Audio or MIDI Bus                 | A bus is a pseudo-track where multiple    |
|                                   | audio tracks can be mixed together for    |
|                                   | some common processing before being       |
|                                   | routed to the Master Bus (which itself is |
|                                   | a bus). A bus doesn\'t contain any        |
|                                   | regions or audio/MIDI data, it is fed a   |
|                                   | signal by [sends](@@aux-sends) from one   |
|                                   | or multiple other tracks, or by           |
|                                   | [connecting tracks                        |
|                                   | outputs](@@audiomidi-busses-mixer-strips) |
|                                   | to the bus\' input. Busses are often used |
|                                   | to apply one effect on multiple tracks,   |
|                                   | with the benefits of having the same      |
|                                   | parameters and less computer processing   |
|                                   | required as only one instance of the      |
|                                   | plugin is used.\                          |
|                                   | Ardour can differentiate Audio busses     |
|                                   | from MIDI busses, allowing e.g. one       |
|                                   | instrument plugin to be used for several  |
|                                   | MIDI tracks.\                             |
|                                   | A bus output can also be routed to        |
|                                   | another bus.                              |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| VCA                               | A [VCA]{.abbr                             |
|                                   | title="Voltage-Controlled Amplifier"} is  |
|                                   | a way to group together tracks or busses  |
|                                   | to enable grouped-control over gain, solo |
|                                   | and mute. Like the Bus, it does not       |
|                                   | contain regions, but unlike it, it does   |
|                                   | not contain effects either. VCAs are      |
|                                   | commonly used to group together related   |
|                                   | tracks (e.g. \"drums\" or \"vocals\") to  |
|                                   | allow controlling the gain of all those   |
|                                   | tracks at once in the mix while retaining |
|                                   | their relative gain.\                     |
|                                   | VCAs are fed audio by [assigning          |
|                                   | them](@@control-masters-mixer-strips) to  |
|                                   | one or more tracks or busses.             |
